</font>

<font size="+0" face="Courier" color="000000">
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">

      <p>The term 
        "sail panel" refers to the triangular piece of Plexiglas behind each door 
        on the "notchback" style Fiero. It is also called the "quarter window" 
        and in their parts manual, GM calls it an "applique". Since the panel is 
        in the shape of a triangular sail on 
        a boat, we like the term "sail panel" as it is more descriptive. We use 
        the term "sail panel" to mean the piece of Plexiglas only, <u>not</u> including 
        the black triangular mounting frame that attaches to the car.</p>

        
      <p>Replacement 
        sail panels are available in plain black (as originally used on several 
        Fiero models), with "SE" or "GT" lettering, with artwork of just about 
        any type, or left clear. If left clear it is assumed you will take care 
        of your own painting and artwork.</p>
      
      <p>Lettering 
        for the "SE" or "GT" is a near-duplicate of the original factory letters. 
        Each graphic is cut by computer and the results look very good. The standard 
        color lettering is silver for SE models and red and silver for the '85 
        GT. You can have any artwork you want in place of the standard letters 
        provided it will fit on the sail panel. Cost depends on complexity and 
        size.  See the Custom Graphics section for details.</p>
      
      <p>Replacement sail panels are 0.060" thick which 
        is just about the same thickness we found on an 1988 Fiero 
        Formula. This provides good flexibility so that fitting to the sail panel 
        frame is easy. At one time we used thicker material but what we use 
        now fits much better and does not have a tendency pull loose.</p>

      
      <p>Due to temperature 
        changes, shipping stresses, or storage conditions the as-received sail panel 
        will not conform perfectly to the sail panel frame without slight pressure. 
        This slight adjustment takes care of itself as you press the sail panel into 
        the frame. The double-sided tape easily holds the sail panel in place 
        as it is pressed into position. See the HOW TO REMOVE &amp; REPLACE procedure 
        for details.</p>

      <p>If you have 
        concerns about the sail panels we will be happy to answer any questions. 
        Alternatively, you can contact some of the people under "REFERENCES" for 
        their opinion.</p>
