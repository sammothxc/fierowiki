<p><b>'85-88 V-6:</b>	On the V-6 engine, the 2-wire cable (pigtail) from the
distributor to ignition coil is about 10" long (250 mm) and is no longer
available from GM.  A similar wiring cable, without the protective
plastic wire loom, is available from the '84-85 Z28 Camaro.  It may be
available from other Camaros or Firebirds of similar vintage but we
can't yet confirm this.  A similar pigtail is also available for
Chevrolet S-10 trucks of the late '80s which had the same V-6 engine as
the Fiero.
