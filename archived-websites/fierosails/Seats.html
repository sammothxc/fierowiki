<font face="Courier"> 

<p><b>SEATS '84-88:</b> The Fiero driver's seat is notorious for tearing on the bolster
due to wear from the driver's repeated entry and exit.  The upholstery can be repaired 
or replaced by any competent auto upholstery shop.  The seat backs in the '84-85 Fiero
have provisions for speakers in the headrest.

<p>The two seats in the Fiero are not a direct swap, but the seat bottoms will swap 
and the seat covers will swap.  So you could extend the life of the driver's side 
seat cover by swapping the passenger side base.  The seat backs will not swap due to 
the hardware for the recliner mechanism.

<p>If you wish to use non-Fiero seats, we understand but cannot confirm
the seats below will fit the Fiero.  Some fabrication or modification to mounting 
systems may be required.
<pre>
    '95-99 Chevy Cavalier
      2005 Chevy Cavalier
    '92-93 Pontiac Grand Am
    '93-95 Firebird/Camaro
       '92 Sunbird
       '97 Sunbird
       '99 Sunbird GT
       '94 Saturn SC
    Mid '80s Corvette
    Late '80s Grand Am
    Late '80s early '90s Firebird/Camaro/Tans Am
    Honda Del Sol (years unknown)
    
</pre>	
<p>Seats from other cars may require adapter plates or other fabrication to fit 
the bolt locations in the Fiero.

<p>Leather seat cover kits are available from mrmikes.com and can be installed by a
 competent do-it-yourselfer.
 
<p>We understand that you can add power seats to a Fiero if you can handle the wiring.  
The power seat base in an Oldsmobile Calais (not sure what year) will bolt to a stock 
Fiero seat.  The electric switches in the seat base must be moved to avoid interefering 
with the Fiero parking brake.

<hr><b>SEAT BELTS '84-88:</b> Seat belts wear well and normally do not
need replacing although periodic cleaning is appropriate.  We
understand but cannot confirm that some of the Firebird seat belts are
the same as the Fiero.  We do not know which model years but suspect
late '80s.
