The procedure for ordering is:</p>
      <p>(1) Tell us what you want via the form below. You are under no obligation 
      and NO PAYMENT IS SENT at this time. Simply describe what you want.  Using the 
      form insures we have sufficient information to provide a complete quotation.  
      Please note all prices are US$ and payment must be in US$.</p>

      <p>(2) We confirm 
        your request and total price by return e-mail. <b>(See Payment and Shipping.)</b> 
        If you are in agreement, let us know and send payment by check, money 
        order, or bank transfer. We also accept credit card payment via PayPal 
        (paypal.com) if you will include the PayPal fee.  Our PayPal address is
        "fierosails@yahoo.com".  <b>We do not take credit card orders via phone. </b>If you wish to 
        use a credit card and are not familiar with PayPal we can send you a 
        PayPal "invoice" so all you have to do is follow the step-by-step on-line 
        instructions to use your card.  If you want to utilize a bank transfer, 
        please contact us.  Our mailing address for checks or money orders is 
        below. Please make checks payable to "Paul McKibben", NOT "fierosails.com".</p>

        FORM</b></font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The form 
        below is essential to the way our system works.  We of course respond to email and
        phone calls, but we work best via the form for initial contact.  You need to submit the form only 
        once; subsequent communication via email is fine. By the way, we <b>NEVER</b>

        disclose your personal information to anyone withour your prior consent. 
        You will never receive spam due to any action by us.</p>

<p>We prefer to correspond by e-mail but if for some reason that doesn't work 
        for you our phone is (770) 409-0719. We are in Norcross, Georgia (near 
        Atlanta). Please use common sense, observe normal business hours, 
        and allow for any time differences when calling.  It's no fun and we're 
        pretty grumpy taking calls at 2:00 AM.  (Yes, it happens.)</p></font>

        
      <p><b>PLEASE NOTE WE DO NOT CARRY QUARTER WINDOWS FOR THE '86-88 "FASTBACK" GT, NOR DO WE MAKE SAIL PANELS

<p>A free "fierosails.com" decal for the rear window of your Fiero will be sent with your order if you ask 
for it in the order form.  The color is white and it's about 8 inches long and 1 inch high.  It looks like this:</p>
