<font face="Courier"> 

<p>Most Fiero wheels have a plastic cap in the center of
the wheel.  Some '86-87 models have a Fiero emblem on the cap.  The '84, '85 and
'88s are blank.  Identical blank caps can be found on late '80s
Pontiacs.  The Fiero logo decal can be added to the blank caps if
desired.  Blank caps are still available from GM but of course they are
pricey.  (Center cap decals available at fierosails.com.)
