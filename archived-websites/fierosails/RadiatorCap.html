<font face="Courier"> 

<p><b>RADIATOR:</b>  The aluminum core radiators used in Fieros are
unique and no other cars use these identical radiators.  (One of the
Chevette radiators is very similar except for mounting holes.)  Some
models of the Fiero have thinner radiators than others.  The thicker
model has greater cooling capacity and will swap to any Fiero.  The V-6
Fiero came standard with the thicker radiator. Fieros with the four
cylinder engine used both types during their production lifetime.  The
"thin" radiator has a size of 15" x 19.75" x 1".  The "thick" radiator
has a size of 15" x 19.75" x 1.375".  Replacements are readily available
from conventional parts suppliers. A source for radiators is Auto
Radiator Outlet at 800-252-0333.


<hr>
<p><b>RADIATOR CAP:</b>
The radiator cap in the Fiero is a 15 PSI non-vented type and is readily
available as an aftermarket item.  Be careful to get the non-vented
version to avoid overheating.  EVERY auto parts supplier we have checked
has the wrong radiator cap listed in their computer for the Fiero.  Be certain to 
get the non-vented type.  The original GM cap is preferred, Part No. 10230 
(or 10036879 is the old number).  AC Delco also makes a good replacement cap under 
their number RC27.  It can be found at acdelco.com.  A suitable replacement from 
parts stores is Stant No. 11230.  We also understand that Stant has a new cap 
for the Fiero, No. 45819.  We have not had an opportunity to verify this new 
version and would appreciate feedback from anyone who has.

<p><b>THERMOSTAT CAP:</b> Note that the thermostat cap is not the same as the 
radiator cap.  The thermostat cap is available from AC Delco (acdelco.com) under 
their part number RC40.  This cap is also available from auto parts stores.

<hr>
<p><b>COOLANT HOSES:</b>
The molded coolant hoses for the Fiero appear to be unique and not used
on other cars.  The following list of hoses by Gates Rubber should fit
any V-6 Fiero although some trimming is required on some hoses.

<p>Some of the hoses for '84 are noted as "Cut to fit" and we suspect these 
may fit other cars also.  Some of the Goodyear hoses may be the corrugated 
flexible size to fit multiple vehicles.</p>

<p>You can <b>find a local supplier of the Gates hoses</b> via this web site:
http://www.gates.com/part_locator/reverselookup.cfm</p>

<p>You can <b>find Goodyear parts</b> such as hoses and belts at this web site:
http://partfinder.veyance.com/</p>

<p><b>Note that for an '88 Fiero with air conditioning</b> there is no listing for 
"heater to pipe" hoses.  The best solution we know is to take the old hoses to 
a parts store and ask the clerk to allow you to peruse all the heater hoses for 
a close match.  We have done this successfully and found that getting 
longer-than-necessary hoses with a few of the necessary bends will work.  
We installed such hoses in our '88 and then cut them at the pipe end to suit.</p>

<p>Many Fiero V6 owners report that <b>removal of the hoses/pipes 
to the throttle body</b> will not harm performance.  In fact it is curious that 
these items were provided by GM.  Presumably the hot coolant is routed to the 
throttle body to eliminate icing.  Since the throttle body is unlike a carburator 
and has minimal venturi effect, icing should be impossible.  We have never heard
of icing in a Fiero throttle body.  The throttle body hoses have been removed from both our 
'88 Fieros for years and performance has been unaffected.

<hr>

<p>The Fiero heater core is in the front above the passenger footwell.  This requires hot coolant to be routed 
from the engine to the front of the car.  <b>On the '88 Fiero</b>, the heating hoses 
run from the engine and connect to pipes below the battery next to the base of the 
firewall.  The connection between the rubber hoses and metal pipes is a quick 
disconnect.  The disconnect is plastic and deteriorates over time. The replacement 
is Dorman #800-405. Since this item is not in high demand you will probably have to 
order it if you need it. Stores like AutoZone, Advance Auto, etc., will gladly do 
this. The cost is about $4. Changing the quick disconnect is made easier by using a 
special tool, Dorman #800-408. You can view the Dorman products at 
dormanproducts.com.</p>
