<p><b>HOOD VENTS:</b> Hood vents are not a stock item on the Fiero but
many owners like to add them to their cars.  Late '80s Turbo Pontiac
Sunbirds have vents that look nice on a Fiero and they let air
escape from under the hood.

<p><b>DECK LID VENTS:</b> Another popular addition to the Fiero is a deck lid vent.  The hood scoop
from a 1999 Mustang looks good and is frequently used for this purpose.  Below are 
a couple of sources for scoops:

<p>Other aftermarket scoops can be found via an Internet search.
