<font face="Courier"> 

<p>The photos below show our prototype "wraparound" sail panel for the
"notchback" style Fiero.  (The "notchback" style is any Fiero other than
'86-88 GT.)  At the moment we are simply trying to gage interest in the
style. Frankly, it's difficult to make this sail panel, there are many bugs
yet to be overcome, installation involves a fair amount of work for the
end user, and we don't want to attempt production without some
indication of interest.  This style is definitely not for everyone!

<p>Take a look at the photos, read the installation requirements, and if
you are interested in purchasing a set, please drop me a note at
fierosails@yahoo.com.  There is no obligation, naturally, since this is
a "poll".  Of course if you have suggestions or questions, they
are always welcome.

<p>Assuming the remaining bugs can be worked out, a pair of plain black
wraparound sail panels would be $84.  Graphics can be added at
additional cost.  The "Pegasus" in the sample would be $10 per panel.  A
standard "GT" or "SE" would be $5 per panel.  One-of-a-kind graphics
would have to be priced on an as-requested basis.  Shipping would be
around $5-$6 to the US and Canada, providing we can find a box that will
fit properly.  Double-sided tape is optional (lots of folks provide
their own) at $3 per panel.  A short price list would probably look
something like this:
<li> Set plain black =  $84 + shipping (+tape)
<li> Set "GT" or "SE"=  $94 + shipping (+tape)
<li> Set Pegasus     = $104 + shipping (+tape)

<hr>This shows a standard sail panel and a wraparound panel side-by-side.

<hr>This is another comparison view of the two types of panels.

<hr>Here is stand-alone view of the sail panel in the frame.
<p><img src="images/Wrap_Front.jpg">
<hr>This shows the upper "wraparound" edge.  The leading edge of the
sail panel frame has been modified to recess it about 1/8" so the face
of the sail panel is flush with the face of the frame. This work has to
be done by the purchaser.

<p><img src="images/Wrap_Upper_Edge.jpg">
<hr>These two pictures show the epoxy joints in the leading edge of the frame 
that had to be cut to recess it properly.  The epoxy is special but is easily 
obtained and not expensive.

<p><img src="images/Wrap_Cntr_Joints.jpg">
<hr>This picture shows the two clamps needed to hold the sail panel in place while 
the adhesive sets on the double-sided tape.  Normally the sail panel would have a 
protective cover during this stage, but this was taken for demo purposes.
<p><img src="images/Wrap_Clamps.jpg">
<p>A few points to note:

<p>(1) The sail panel will be provided flat.  The curvature is achieved by the purchaser 
during installation, hence the need for the clamps shown in the photo.

<p>(2) There is a lot of room on the sail panel (compared to the
original) to accommodate graphics.  This might be of interest to
"project" cars or race vehicles.


<p>(3) The front edge of the sail panel must be heated to wrap around the front of the 
sail panel frame.  There is a heat-affected area where this bend occurs and it is 
visible as a slight distortion in the acrylic.  We will try to eliminate this in the 
final product, but it may be impossible.  We tried to show this in the photo, but 
it won't show up.

<p>(4) Detailed instructions on modifying the sail panel frame and installing the sail 
panel will be posted on our web site (with photos) if production becomes a reality.

<p>(5) There is an interior vent at the base of the B pillar near the floor
behind each seat.  This communicates via the inside of the B pillar to
the "vent" in the original sail panel frame.  This affords some
flow-thorough ventilation for the cabin.  The wraparound sail panel will
cover this vent and there may be some concern about adequate ventilation.  Earl 
Sessions has used a "wraparound" sail panel for four years and reports no change 
in ventilation.  A look at the photo below will show why.  There is so much room 
for air to escape around the body panels that we suspect the "vent" 
in the original sail panel may have been for aesthetics.

<p>Thanks for looking, and let us have your feedback.
