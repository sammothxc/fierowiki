We don't have a great deal of information on Fiero clutch systems but
offer what we have. There are two different clutch sizes used in Fieros.
 The 1984 Fiero and all V6 Fieros came with a 9.125" clutch. The 1985-88
4-cylinder Fieros came with a 8.5" clutch. The clutch parts are
interchangeable so if you're replacing the 8.5" clutch it is feasible
to use the larger clutch disc and pressure plate.  This should provide a bit longer 
clutch life.

<p> Note that the throwout bearings are specific to each transaxle,
not the engine or model year, so be sure to get the correct one when replacing.

<p>Fieros with the Muncie 4-speed transaxle (see "Transmission, Manual")
have a pilot bearing but the 5-speed transaxles do not use a pilot bearing.

<b>CLUTCH FORK and PILOT BEARING

being used in other vehicles. Part numbers for aftermarket clutch forks

<b><font face="Courier"><p>CLUTCH PEDAL</p>
</b><p>The aluminum clutch pedal in '84-86 Fieros is prone to bending.
Symptoms of a bent pedal are difficult shifting and/or clutch not fully
disengaging. Pedals in '87-88 Fieros and all replacement pedals are
steel. The GM part number for the steel pedal is 10066423 but it is
generally unavailable. New steel pedals can be found at the Fiero Store
(fierostore.com). With a new GM pedal in the '84-86 Fiero the clutch
pedal spring is eliminated and a new master cylinder push rod and
retainer clip must be installed. We are not sure if this is required
with the Fiero Store pedal. The part numbers for the master cylinder
push rod are 10126424 for '84-85 and 10126423 for '86. The retainer clip
is part number 10040797. A new bushing for the pedal pin is also
recommended. It is part number 14094900.</p>

<p>A replacement for the rubber clutch pedal surface for all years is
Pedal Up! 20733.</p>
