<p><b>EGR TUBE &amp; EGR COVER</b>
<p>
The 2.8L engine has an EGR tube which goes from the EGR valve to the
underside of the intake plenum.  The '85-87 EGR tubes are the same but
the '88 tube is a bit longer.  Earlier tubes can fit an '88 if
stretched.  New "one size fits all" tubes are available from the Fiero
Store.  EGR tubes from 2.8L Camaro and Firebird engines as well as some
other late '80s Pontiacs will fit the Fiero but do not have the heat
shield.  These must have the bolt holes slotted on the end which
attaches to the EGR valve.  These EGR tubes are slightly larger in
diameter and seem to be a bit more rugged than the original Fiero EGR
tubes and work well on the Fiero V-6.
<p>
The EGR valve on the 2.8L Fiero did not come with a cover.  Some late
'80s and early '90s 3.8L GM engines used the same size EGR valve which
did come with black plastic covers.  These can be retrofitted to the
Fiero as a simple snap-on installation.
