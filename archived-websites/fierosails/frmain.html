<p>This on-line "manual" is an outgrowth of my personal attempt to locate
Fiero parts that were not readily found at retail sources. I have
documented my findings here in the hope that it will help others.  If you have an
insurance adjuster, mechanic, or repair shop who believes parts are not
available for your Fiero, directing him here may help.</p>

<p>Please note this manual is NOT a parts catalog, substitute for the
factory parts manual (also known as the "22P" catalog), or the factory
service manual.  And there is no intent to extensively list products carried 
by parts suppliers.  This "manual" is merely an attempt to help guide you to sources 
of used and new parts, many of which interchange with other vehicles.</p>

<p>We intend to update the manual as new information becomes available
and therefore need help from all who are willing to share their
knowledge about Fiero parts.  <b>Please use the e-mail address below to
send information we have missed.</b>  And it's important to keep the
manual as accurate as possible, so <b>please let us know about
errors.</b></p>

<p>Our information was obtained from first-hand knowledge, salvage yard
operators, "Hollander" manuals, parts catalogs, Internet mailing lists,
and Fiero owners and enthusiasts everywhere.  <b>The information is as
accurate as we know how to make it but we are fallible and disclaim
responsibility for inaccuracies or problems you may incur using it!
</b></p>

<p>Note that we have not included parts such as batteries, windshields,
and hundreds of other parts which are readily available direct from GM
or from auto parts stores.  <b><font color="red">If you do not see the part you need,
check the "Parts Sources" link to the left.</b></font>
