<font face="Courier"> <p><b>Crossover Pipe: </b> The V-6 Fiero has a steel
coolant pipe which crosses the firewall to connect under-car coolant
line to the engine.  (The outlet hose from the thermostat neck connects to this 
pipe.)  The pipe is unique to the Fiero and can corrode. 
Replacements can be custom-made at radiator shops or a stainless
replacement can be obtained from rodneydickman.com.  They are also
available from the Fiero Store (fierostore.com)
