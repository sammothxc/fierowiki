       <hr><p><b>Pontiac Document Folder</b>, $5 - This is an original document folder 
      issued by Pontiac in the 1980s.  It was probably not for the Fiero but we 
      don't know.  It has a small stain on the letter "T" which we did not try to 
      remove but otherwise is in fine shape.  Shipping cost would be zero if you 
      purchase this with a set of sail panels.</p>

<hr><p><b>Oil Pan for 3.4L Engine</b>, $25 - This oil pan was destined for our 
3.4 upgrade which we no longer plan to do.  It is in great shape with a 
few very minor dings in the bottom, but the sealing edges are perfect.  
It includes a plug where the oil level sensor (or was it a crank sensor?) 
was once installed.  There are some small patches of surface rust on the 
interior as can be seen in the picture; they will buff off easily.  This 
oil pan will fit the 2.8L block but will not mate with all timing covers.  
As we recall, only the '87-88 timing cover will match this oil pan (but 
we're not certain).  Obviously the timing cover from the 3.4 will match.</p>

<hr><p><b>Shift Knob</b>, $5 - This is a dark gray leather shift knob for an 
automatic transmission.  It could stand a good cleaning but is otherwise in 
good shape as you can see in the photos.</p>

<hr><p><b>Sunroof Glass</b>, $20 - In fine shape but needs cleaning.  Complete 
with hardware.  We don't want to ship this and suggest local pickup.  If you or 
a friend travel through Atlanta via I-85, we could meet you at one of the exits 
on the north side of town.  If you are local to Atlanta we can arrange for 
pickup or perhaps meet you somewhere on the north side.  If you are a member 
of Georgia Fieros, we could bring this to a club meeting.</p>

<hr><p><b>Shift Boot</b>, $10 - This is a new black &amp; white shift boot for a manual 
transmission that was made when we planned a black and white interior for 
our car.  We have changed plans and this brand new shift boot is available.
If you ship this with a set of sail panels, no additional shipping charge 
will be incurred.</p>
