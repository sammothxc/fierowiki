      <p>The various 
        adhesive vinyl letters originally applied to the Fiero have been called 
        "decals". Since that seems to be the convention, we call them "decals" 
        also.</p>

      <p>We make Fiero 
        decals like the originals and we make custom decals. All of them are 
        available in any color or size. Below is a display of what we have readily 
        available.  If you are looking for something different, just 
        <a href="email.html?subject=Contact Us.">Contact Us.</a> Or to order, use the 
        <a href="order.html?subject=Order Form">Order Form</a>. We look forward to hearing from you.</p>


      <p><b>Instructions</b> 
        for applying decals to your car are at the bottom of this page and a few of 
        our samples are below.</p>

<p><a href="images/SunshadeInstructions.jpg"><img src="images/SunshadeInstructions.jpg" align="center" width="300" height="242" border="0"></a> </p>
<p>Does your Fiero have a sunroof?  Does it have a sunshade?  If yes, you probably don't have 
the original GM instruction sheet that came with it.  To keep your car authentic, or 
just to have accurate information, its great to have this document.  We found 
an original GM instruction sheet for installing the sunshade, we scanned it, and are making it 
available here for no-charge download. </p>
<p>The file is an un-compressed PDF file and requires Adobe Reader or other similar 
application (such as "Preview" for you lucky Mac owners) to view it.  If you print the 
file, which we suggest, reduce it as needed to fit within an 8.5" x 11" sheet of paper. 
Our printer driver did fine without any reduction, but yours may not.</p>

      <p><b>1988 Fiero Specifications</b>, $6 including shipping in US.</p>

<p><a href="images/MMVSCover.jpg"><img src="images/MMVSCover.jpg" align="center" width="274" height="362" border="0"></a> Cover

<a href="images/MMVSContent.jpg"><img src="images/MMVSContent.jpg" align="center" width="279" height="369" border="0"></a> Contents </p>

      <p>Years ago we obtained 5 copies of the factory specs on our '88 Fiero to use 
      during restoration.  Of course we used only one of the copies and have the remainder 
      available for those interested in the detailed specs on their car.  While specific 
      to 1988, they are of value to all years since nearly all of the details were consisistent 
      from 1984-88.  If you need to know detailed body dimensions such as clearances, 
      widths, heights, materials for specific parts, spring rates, etc., this document 
      will help.  A total of 34 photocopied pages stapled together and shipped flat (no 
      folds) via First Class mail to a US address.  Contact us for shipment costs ouside 
      the US.  Only a few available.  Note that if you are purchasing a set of sail panels, we 
      frequently can add these specs to the order at no additional shipping cost.  Contact 
      us for verification.</p>

      <p><b>Car Cover Artwork</b>, $20 including shipping in the U.S. for 12" Fiero logo.</p>

<p><a href="images/CarCoverEmblem.jpg"><img src="images/CarCoverEmblem.jpg" align="center" width="160" height="120" border="0"></a> </p>
      <p>Customize any car cover with artwork of your selection using a paint mask 
      (stencil) and fabric paint.  The photo shows a 12" high Fiero logo but you can have custom artwork 
      of any size.  For example how about a logo with "Formula" or "Fiero GT"?  
      Or Casper the Friendly Ghost, a Pegasus, Pontiac arrowhead or whatever your imagination can conceive.  
      Our photo shows a 12" size and the mask is $20.  Other artwork and sizes are priced 
      according to area and complexity.  The photo in the link shows the simple steps involved to apply
      the artwork.</p>

      <p><b>Spare Tire Cover Artwork</b>, $18 including shipping in the U.S. for 11.5" Fiero 
      or Fiero GT logo.</p>

<p><a href="images/TireCover.jpg"><img src="images/TireCover.jpg" align="center" width="288" height="246" border="0"></a> </p>

      <p>Customize a spare tire cover with artwork of your selection using a paint mask 
      (stencil) and vinyl paint.  The photo shows a white 11.5" high Fiero GT logo but you can have custom artwork 
      of any size and color.  Artwork is priced according to size and complexity.  If you don't have a spare tire cover, 
      get one on eBay from Pixelman Digital Products (use the "search" feature) for under $20 including shipping.  
      Ask for the Size "O" black ADCO Spare tire cover which fits a 22" diameter tire.  Then use our paint mask 
      to apply artwork.  Use the instructions for the car cover above, but rub the edges of the paint 
      mask with a finger while heating with a hair dryer for better sealing.  Apply paint using light coats to avoid 
      seepage beneath edges.  This is much less expensive than the $45 plus shipping for a plain black cover 
      from traditional Fiero suppliers, plus you get a custom graphic.</p>

      <p><b>Hood Decal, Pegasus</b>, 
        $70 including shipping in the U.S. Colors are typically silver, white, 
        red, or black but other colors are available. The decal is about 36" high 
        and 24" wide and fits between the raised "ribs" on the hood. It comes 
        with backing material and is shipped in a roll. It is important to unroll 
        the decal upon arrival and let it "relax" until it is flat prior to 
        installation. 
        Otherwise the tendency to curl will hinder application.</p>

      <p><b>Hood Decal, 'Fiero-Bird'</b>, 
        $95 including shipping in the U.S. Colors are typically silver, white, 
        red, or black but other colors are available.  The decal is 43" wide x 42" high  
        (like the "Firebird" decal). This size is difficult for most installers 
        to handle and expensive to ship so we make it in two halves.  Installation 
        instructions with layout dimensions are included 
        <a href="https://web.archive.orgimages/HoodInstructions.jpg" target="_new">HERE</a>.
        Upon receipt it is important to unroll the decal and keep it flat until 
        it is installed.  Otherwise the tendency to curl will hinder application.</p>

      <p><b>Hood Decal, Fiero Logo</b>, 
        $50 including shipping in the U.S. Colors are typically silver, white, 
        red, or black but other colors are available. The decal is about 30" high 
        and 23" wide. Available as "Fiero" or "Fiero GT".  It comes with backing material and is shipped in a roll. It 
        is important to unroll the decal upon arrival and let it "relax" until it 
        is flat prior to installation.  Otherwise the tendency to curl will hinder 
        application.</p>

      <p><b>Hood Decal, Checkered Flag Style</b>, 
        $85 including shipping in the U.S. Color can be just about anything, but 
        black, white, red, and silver are typical. The decal covers the full width 
        of the area between the raised "ribs" on the hood except for 2" in the 
        center.  The length is a bit longer than the hood itself to permit trimming 
        to the exact hood contour.  It ships rolled in two pieces (one for each side 
        of the hood).</p>

      <p><b>Body Stripe Kit</b>, $165 including shipping in the U.S. Typical colors 
      are red, black, white, silver and yellow but other colors are available.  
      Non-stock colors may involve additional cost.  The kit includes 8" stripes 
      sufficient to cover the full length of a Fiero.  The hood portion includes the 
      Pegasus-in-shield and two stripes (with 2"gap) as one entire decal.  REMAINING
      STRIPES ARE 8" WIDE PIECES APPLIED INDIVIDUALLY.  (This is to economize on material.)  
      To achieve a 2" gap, we suggest you apply a 2" piece of masking tape down the center 
      of your car, then align the individual 8" stripes against the tape.  After the stripes are in 
      place, remove the masking tape.</p>

      <p>The sample photos show the yellow Pegasus high on the hood to avoid the scoops but 
      it can be centered on the hood or positioned to suit; you will need to let us 
      know your preference.  The white version by Alex Santos shows the standard version, although 
      Alex's car has 9" wide stripes instead of 8".</p>

<p><b>"Pontiac" Windshield Decal</b> - We have three styles available and each is $30 including shipping.  
Color is typically white but available in other colors upon request.  All decals have 
curvature to match the top of the windshield.  <b>(See our "Bargains" section for discounted versions.)</b></p>

<p>Style 1 is a spot-on reproduction of an original Indy Fiero windshield decal courtesy of 
Tim Cebulla.  Tim provided a "rubbing" of his original 1984 decal and we reproduced it 
pretty much exactly.  As far as we can tell by comparison to original photos, this is 
the same decal that was on the actual '84 Pace Car.  It is about 41" wide with 4.4" letters
and Tim reports that it misses the sweep of the windshield wipers on his Indy 
<b>IF</b> shorter wipers are used.  If standard length wipers are used, they do hit 
the decal.  Hence Style 2 below.</p>

<p>Style 2 was made from a GM "New Old Stock" decal we borrowed from Ed Parks at The Fiero 
Factory.  It is our understanding this version was sold by GM as a replacement for the 
Style 1.  It is about 40" wide with 3" letters and will miss the sweep of the windshield 
wipers.</p>

<p>Style 3 uses the standard Pontiac trademark lettering.  It is about 40" wide with 3.5"
letters and it too will miss the sweep of the windshield wipers.</p>

<p><font color="red">Note that we have all the above decals in the outline style for the same price. </font>

      <p><b>"Fiero GT" Windshield Decal #1</b>, $45 including shipping in the U.S. Typically 
        white but available in just about any color.  This decal has the Fiero logo 
        on either side and is curved to accomodate the windshield.  <b>(See our "Bargains" section for discounted 
        versions.)</b></p>

      <p><b>"Fiero GT" Windshield Decal #2</b>, $35 including shipping in the U.S. Typically 
        white but available in just about any color.  This decal was made from a
        <a href="images/FieroGT2.jpg" target="new"> factory original</a> 
        generously loaned to us by Kevin Lindeman in Minnesota.  Kevin provided the 
        <a href="images/DecalBox.jpg" target="new"> original box</a>

        and <a href="images/Decal_Instructions.jpg" target="new"> instructions</a> along with the decal.  The 
        instructions indicate the "GT" can be cut from the decal and the "Fiero" portion installed 
        on any Fiero.  We don't yet have a photo of this decal installed on a customer's car.</p>

      <p><b>"Formula"</b> 
        door decal, $25 including shipping in the U.S. ($45 for a pair). Colors are typically silver, 
        medium gray metallic, or black, but available 
        in just about any choice. This decal is about 2" high and 24" wide, just 
        like the original.  (You may find reproduction Formula decals specified as about 22.25" long; we 
        believe these may have been for the Firebird Formula.) It comes with the backing material beveled on both 
        ends for alignment purposes. This means no measuring is required to apply the decal.  Simply align the bevel with the bottom rear edge 
        of the door and the decal is properly placed horizontally. (See layout 
        drawing at the bottom of the page.) The "Formula" 
        is also available as a <b>windshield decal</b> for $40. It is curved to 
        match the top curvature of the windshield and provides clearance for windshield 
        wipers.  <b>(See our "Bargains" section for discounted versions.)</b></p>

      <p><a href="images/Formula.gif"><img src="images/Formula.gif" align="center" width="440" height="41" border="0"></a></p>

<p>By the way, if you are wondering which color door decal was applied to a particular car color, the Pontiac 
22P Parts Manual provides the answer:</p>

<p><b>Silver Metallic</b> decals were used on black, red, and medium red metallic (maroon) Formulas<br>
<b>Medium Gray Metallic</b> decals were used on yellow, silver, and white Formulas</p>

<p>For maintaining accuracy when restoring your Formula, we believe our 
decals are the best.  In 1997 we purchased original "Formula" door decals for our own restoration and 
used them as models for the decals we now sell.</p>

      <hr>

      <p><b>Indy Door Decal</b>, $40 each including shipping in the U.S.  This decal was made 
      from a factory original courtesy of David Kancsar.  David's car was purchased in late 2007 
      with just 4300+ miles on the odometer and came with an <a href="images/OldDecal.jpg" target="new">original</a>
      unused door decal 
      which he generously loaned us.  So our reproduction is very accurate and not just a 
      simple knock-off made using block letters. Note that several of the letters are joined. 
      This feature is missing from many of the eBay and other aftermarket versions we have seen.  
      <b>(See our "Bargains" section for discounted versions.)</b></p>

      
      <p>As a final note, the original decal color was "Medium Gray Metallic" rather than black 
      although it is hard to tell the difference when applied unless the two colors are 
      side-by-side.  We can supply the Medium Gray Metallic for an additional $5 per decal.

      <p><b>Indy Wings</b> decal, Silver/black/red, $7 for one or $12 for two including shipping in the U.S.
      For those who want to protect that expensive fender badge which originally came with the Indy,
      this is an option.  Remove the original badge when you can't keep an eye on your Indy and use 
      the decal, or put the decal on your "faux" Indy.  Or just use it on the dash, door, glovebox,
      or other area of your car for dress-up.  Same size as original badge (a bit over 4" wide).  
      Simple peel-and-stick.</p>

<hr>
<p><b>Indy Nose Badge</b> decal, Silver/black/red, $12 including shipping in the U.S.  Good for that 
      "faux" Indy or whatever application you wish.  Same size as original nose badge so you can 
      put it right over an existing nose badge. Peel-and-stick.</p>

      <p><b>Indy Engine Decals</b>, black/red, $35 including shipping in the U.S.  Colors can be
      changed if requested.  Note that engine heat is hard on decals.  We suggest using a paint 
      mask (stencil) to paint the image.  Paint masks are the same price as decals.</p>

      <p><a href="images/IndyDecals.jpg"><img src="images/IndyDecals.jpg" align="center" width="303" height="280" border="0"></a> </p>
<p>Note #1: Using a paint mask on the air cleaner may not be easy if you have no experience.  Some 
Indy owners advise they are using a decal in this location instead of a paint mask, but using the 
masks for the other engine graphics.  We can provide masks/decal combinations if you wish.</p>

<p>Note #2: The valve cover has two grommeted holes.  The distance between these holes seems to 
vary.  If you provide us with the center-to-center distance between holes, we will adjust the 
paint mask or decal (whichever you order) to fit your particular valve cover.</p>

      <p><b>Indy Wheel Stripes</b>, $40 + $5 shipping in the U.S. if a solo order.  
      This is a set of four red wheel stripes that are mounted to the Indy wheels.  The

      amount of material required.</p>

      <p>The stripes are not straight forward to apply without knowing the tricks.  Along with 
      Kevin Gibler's photo, above, we offer this link to a writeup of his installation notes 
      and photos from Pennock's Fiero Forum:</p>

      <p>Perhaps the key point for proper installation is cutting out 
      the center of the wheel stripe decal so it sits flat on the rim of the wheel.

<p><b>New Fiero logo</b> fender decal, $13 each including shipping in the U.S. </p>

      <p>The artwork on this decal was designed by Andrew Rogers of New York and has been popularized as the 
      "New Fiero Logo".  At Andrew's suggestion, $1 from the sale of each decal will be donated to Pennock's 
      Fiero Forum where the artwork was first published and found a following.  We have the new logo here as 
      a fender decal although it can be applied anywhere.  The size is 3" wide x 4" high.  Four color combinations
      are shown and other customized color combinations are feasible.  Since we use commercial materials for the 
      decals we cannot get a true match to any car color.  Additional text such as "Formula", "3.4 Turbo", "4.9 PFI", 
      etc., can be added below the "Fiero" for your special project.  Custom text or colors will add $4 per decal.</p>

<p><b>Wheel Center Decals</b> $10 for a set of 4 in black, $15 for a set of 4 black with 
a color background.  For $5 additional the Fiero logo can be in colors other than black.  The photos 
below show the decals mounted on Fiero wheel center caps which are 2" diameter.  Note that we are providing the decals only, not the 
caps. If you would like to have colored caps we can provide the colored background as shown in the yellow 
sample.  (The background is available for any decal, not just the plain logo.)  However if you paint the 
wheel caps the color will maintain it's looks longer than adhesive vinyl, so you may wish to consider 
painting your wheel caps and using the 
basic decal for the image.  Also we cannot match the exact color of your car with vinyl.  If you have wheel 
center caps other than 2" diameter, we can make them to suit but pricing may be a bit more than the 2" 
size.</p>

      <b>INSTRUCTIONS 
      FOR APPLYING DECALS TO YOUR CAR</b>  
      <p>1. Work at 
        room temperature if possible since the adhesive on the decals works best 
        when warm. </p>

      <p>2. Clean 
        the surface where the decals are to be applied, first with soap and water, 
        then wipe down with isopropyl alcohol to remove any possible remaining 
        oil, wax, or soap film. </p>

      <p>3. The as-received decal is a "sandwich" of three 
      materials. At the bottom is the carrier paper, in the middle is the artwork (the 
      decal itself), and on top is an adhesive paper called "transfer tape". 
      Without removing any of 
        these three parts of the decal, hold it in place by hand and move it around 
        until you have it in what you think is the final position. (Use a measuring 
        tape to get the decal parallel or center to body components or trim lines.) </p>

      <p>4. Apply 
        a piece of masking tape full length across the top of the decal to hold 
        it in position and measure carefully to verify the final location. Re-position 
        as necessary. </p>
      <p>5. Using 
        the masking tape as a hinge, flip the decal completely over so the opposite 
        side is fully exposed. Starting at the top of the decal, use a fingernail 
        or knife blade to carefully peel the carrier paper away from the artwork. 
        Pull slowly. The artwork must not stick to the carrier paper; it should 
        remain on the sticky transfer tape. </p>
        
      <p>6. If you 
        have a large decal such as used on a hood or windshield, use a spray bottle 
        of water to wet both the decal and the car at this time. A few drops of 
        soap added to the water will help. The water film will assist if you need 
        to remove and reposition the decal, plus it will help get rid of bubbles 
        when you use the squeegee in Steps 7 and 8. </p>

        
        <p><b>Note: </b>You can use a commercially available decal application fluid in place of 
        water to help apply the decal.  A commercial product may be advantageous on a 
        large decal or body stripes.  Several brands are available, one of which is 
        Rapid-Tac, and they can be found on-line at eBay or with a Google search.</p>

        
      <p>7. When the 
        carrier is peeled away, carefully lower the transfer tape with its artwork 
        onto the car making sure the upper center section of the artwork touches 
        first. As you slowly lower the decal, use a squeegee (finger pressure 
        or a credit card are ok on small decals) to smooth the artwork from the 
        center outward against the car. This will help minimize bubbles. Do NOT 
        lower the entire decal (or large portions of it) and then apply the squeegee. 
        Let the squeegee gently push the decal against the car so bubbles are 
        not trapped under the vinyl. </p>

      <p>8. With the 
        transfer tape and masking tape still attached, rub the artwork through 
        the transfer tape with a squeegee until it is firmly adhered. Look for 
        bubbles at this time and work them out by squeezing them to the edge of 
        the artwork. </p>
        
      <p>9. Peel away 
        the masking tape and transfer tape. Work carefully to insure that the 
        artwork stays on the car and does not adhere to the transfer tape. This 
        is especially important to watch if you have sprayed the decal with water. 
        In fact if you have used water or other decal application fluid on a large 
        decal, you may have to wait 2-4 hours for the fluid to dry before removing 
        the transfer tape.  Otherwise the decal will stick to the transfer tape 
        and not to the vehicle.
        </p>

      <p>10. With 
        the transfer tape removed, burnish the artwork firmly but carefully if 
        any bubbles remain. Do not catch the edges as this may cause the artwork 
        to tear. Look at the artwork in good light to make sure bubbles are not 
        left under it. If they are, burnish these areas carefully. It is possible 
        to eliminate troublesome bubbles by puncturing them with a sharp pin, 
        then burnishing. If water was used, it may take a few hours for traces 
        to evaporate from under the vinyl; adhesion at this time may be weak. 
        </p>

      <p>Now step 
        back and admire your completed work. The decal is is adhered sufficiently 
        to immediately use the car, but full ahesion will occur over about 48 
        hours as the adhesive cures.
        
        <p><b>Tip: </b> If you have a decal that has several components such as a windshield decal with 
        several letters,
        it can be cut into smaller sections AFTER it is taped in final position but before the
        backing paper is removed.  For example the "Pontiac" decal can be cut between every 
        second or third letter.  This makes application easier with several small pieces 
        instead of one large piece.  In fact you can cut between every letter if that makes you 
        more comfortable.</p>

        
        <p><b>Long-Term Care: </b>Keep your decal clean and do not allow solvents or soap to get 
        under the edges.  Use of "303 Aerospace Protectant" every few months will extend the life of a 
        decal and we recommend it, especially in sunny climates.  You can find 303 Protectant on-line 
        with a Google search.  It is sometimes available at auto parts stores.</p></font>
