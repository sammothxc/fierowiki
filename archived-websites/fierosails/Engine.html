<p>A "complete" engine means cylinder block and heads.  It does not include accessories such as alternator, water pump, A/C compressor, etc., although some of these parts from a donor engine may coincidentally fit the Fiero.

<p>The following information was posted to Pennock's Fiero Forum by "Ray" from Houston, TX:</p>

<p>It is possible to get a better 2.5L engine for the '87-88 2.5L Fiero from a 1993 S-10.  The 2.5L engine from the '93 S-10 should provide over 100 HP and considerably better mileage.</p>

<b>'88 Fiero 2.5L Engine:</b> The following engines can be used in a Fiero except for the flywheel or flexplate.  Change induction, exhaust, and electrical systems, pilot bushings as necessary.  Will not interchange with '87 engines due to oil pan interference with frame.

<b>NOTE 1:</b> A popular swap for the Fiero 2.8L engine is a 3.4L engine from a '93-95 
Camaro or Firebird.  This engine requires simple modifications that are beyond the 
scope of this manual.  Other popular swaps are the Chevrolet Small Block V8 and the 
Cadillac 4.9L V8.  For more information check v8archie.com and thefierofactory.com.</p>

<p>
<b>NOTE 2:</b> New engine mounts are appropriate when replacing an engine.  The 
1988 mounts can be expensive.  Robert Lachance advises that you can use the front engine 
mount from a early '90s Pontiac Transport 3.8 (non-supercharged) on a 1988 2.8L Fiero engine for about 
$100 less than the Fiero-specific mount from parts stores.  No modification is required. 
We don't have the part number at this time but Robert reports the mount is available from GM dealers. 
If anyone can provide the part number, please let us know.
