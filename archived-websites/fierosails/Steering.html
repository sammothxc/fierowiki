<b>CONTROL ARM, UPPER</b> The upper control arm is unique to the Fiero. 
If parts are interchanged from other Fieros, note that beginning in 1986
GM provided a revised design with 1.6 degrees more positive camber. 
This arm was listed as a replacement for '84-85 Fieros (in the event
replacement was required due to damage).  Later in 1986 GM reverted to
the earlier design.  To minimize confusion, we are listing the part
numbers for all years so it can be easily determined which control arms
are used in each car.

<b>REAR STRUTS</b>

<p><b>'84-87:</b> The rear struts are unique to the '84-87 Fiero.  Replacements
are readily available from parts stores provided old springs are
transferred to new struts.

<p><b>'88:</b> The rear struts are unique to the '88 Fiero. 
Replacements are  available provided old springs are transferred to new
struts.  The top mounting plate for the strut differed on the GT and
Formula which had the heavy-duty "WS6" suspension.  Monroe strut number
10097835 will work for the '88 Fiero.  Earlier year struts will work on
the '88 if the holes are elongated where the strut mounts to the
knuckle.

<p><b>Rear Strut Mount Kit:</b> A rear strut mounting kit for all Fieros
is Strut-Tite 69647.

<hr>
<b>SUSPENSION BUSHINGS</b>

<p>Rubber bushings for Fiero control arms, sway bars, and sway bar links
are no longer listed as available from GM.  Moog makes aftermarket
rubber bushings for the '84-87 Fiero and GM has part numbers that are
said to work for the '88.  Polyurethane bushings are also popular
replacements and can be found at suspensionparts.com.

<b>SPRINGS, FRONT</b>

<p><b>'84:</b> The front springs are unique to the '84 Fiero.  Various spring
rates were available.  (We don't know how many).  If springs are
transferred from another Fiero they should be in pairs.  The springs are
identified by yellow tags.  If the tags are missing it is impossible to
determine the spring rate by visual inspection.

<p><b>'85-87:</b> The front springs are unique to the '85-87 Fiero. 
Various spring rates were available.  (We don't know how many).  If
springs are transferred from another Fiero they should be in pairs.  The
springs are identified by yellow tags.  If the tags are missing it is
impossible to determine the spring rate by visual inspection.

<p><b>'88:</b> The front springs are unique to the '88 Fiero.  At least five
spring rates were available.  If springs are transferred from another
Fiero they should be in pairs.  The springs are identified by yellow
tags.  If the tags are missing it is impossible to determine the spring
rate by visual inspection.
<hr>
<b>SPRINGS, REAR</b>

<p><b>'84-87:</b> The rear springs are unique to the '84-87 Fiero.  At least
four spring rates were available.  If springs are transferred from
another Fiero they should be in pairs.  The springs are identified by
yellow tags.  If the tags are missing it is impossible to determine the
spring rate by visual inspection.

<p><b>'88:</b> The rear springs are unique to the '88 Fiero.  At least four

rate by visual inspection.

<b>STEERING RACK &amp; PINION</b>

<p><b>'84 - 87:</b> The steering rack includes the inner tie rods as well as
the rack and pinion.  All '84-87 Fiero steering racks will interchange. 
However there were two steering ratios available.  The "quicker" ratio
was used in all '84 cars and in '85-87 cars equipped with the WS6
option.  (See Option Codes at the front of this manual.)  No other cars
used the same steering rack as the Fiero.

<p><b>'88:</b> The steering rack includes the inner tie rods as well as the
rack and pinion.  No other cars, including earlier Fieros, used the same
steering rack.  There were two steering ratios available.  The "quicker"
ratio was used on the GT or if the RPO sticker indicates the car had the
WS6 option.  (See Option Codes at the front of this manual.)  The '88 Fiero
was intended to have power steering but this was dropped.  No production
Fiero ever had power steering.

<hr>
<b>STEERING WHEEL &amp; COLUMN</b>

<p><b>'84-88:</b> Steering wheels used in the Fiero were also used in many
other late '80s GM cars except for the Fiero in the center horn button. 
Fiero steering wheels with horn "paddles" are identical to other GM cars
of the same vintage.

<p><b>The steering columns</b> used in the Fiero are unique and not used in other
cars; there are no known direct swaps.  There were at least fourteen
variations in '84-85 involving tilt, wiper options, and ignition switch
variations.  All year Fiero steering columns will fit any Fiero with the
exception of these potential variations.  Steering columns can be rebuilt or purchased outright at columnsgalore.com/rebuilt.htm.
