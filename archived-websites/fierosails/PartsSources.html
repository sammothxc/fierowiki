<p>The first place to look for parts is a local auto parts store or GM dealer.  
New parts  will be the most expensive but generally best choice for replacements. 
In cases such as body panels new parts are not available from these traditional 
sources and used parts are the only option.  Hopefully the remainder of this 
on-line manual will assist in that regard.</p>

<p>The Internet has made the search for Fiero parts an almost casual exercise.  
We have listed a handful of the more popular sources below.  A Google search 
will yield hundreds more.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>www.fierosails.com</b> Fiero sail panels (quarter windows) for the 
"notchback" style Fiero plus OEM and custom decals and graphics.  Located near 
Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

<p><b>www.eBay.com</b> Hundreds of Fiero parts for sale at any given time.

<p><b>www.fiero.nl</b> A high-traffic site with Fiero discussion groups and a 
"Mall" with active sellers and buyers of all kinds of Fiero parts.  Post a 
"wanted" item if you can't find what you need.  Questions posted to one of 
the discussion forums will provide a quick and informative response.</p>

<p><b>www.thefierofactory.com</b> Jeremy Biggs at The Fiero Factory in Toney, 
Alabama, specializes in Fiero restoration and engine swaps and also has 
virtually any Fiero part.</p>

<p><b>www.fierodave.com/</b> Lots of new old stock (NOS) and used Fiero parts.

<p><b>www.fieroservice.com</b> Very reputable source of Fiero parts,

<p><b>www.fierowarehouse.com</b> Best known for "fastback" quarter windows 
('86-88 GT) but has many other hard-to-find parts such as electrical switches.  
Good service.  Located in West Virginia.</p>

<p><b>www.gmpartsdirect.com</b> Probably the least expensive source for new GM parts,
although for small items the shipping cost can make them unattractive.  GM part numbers are needed 
to use this site.  Part numbers can be obtained from the "22P" manual, if you can find one.  (They 
are no longer published but appear on eBay from time to time.)  The 22P can also be downloaded in PDF 
format from a couple of sources on the 'Net.  See our
