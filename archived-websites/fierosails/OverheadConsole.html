<p>The overhead console in the Fiero contains cabin lights and, in cars so equipped, 
the control for the subwoofer system.  If you are willing to do a little modification 
there are a couple of overhead consoles which we understand can be retrofit to the 
Fiero to update it and provide a bit more room for other electronics.</p>

<p>Supposedly the overhead console from a Grand Am and a GMC Jimmy will fit the 
Fiero with some minor modifications to the Fiero headliner.  At this writing we do 
not know which model years provide the best version of the overhead console.  If you 
perform this modification we would appreciate feedback with details.</p>
