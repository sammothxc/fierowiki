<font color="#ff0000"><h1 align="CENTER">ADDITIVES THAT WORK</h1></font>

<font color="0000"><h3 align="CENTER">by Larry Carley - Courtesy of Family Handyman Magazine, Feb 
2012 </h3> </font>


<font face="Courier">
<p><b>FUEL ADDITIVES</b></p>

<p>"All gasoline contains fuel injection cleaner.  But 'Top Tier' gasoline (marked 
on the pump at the gas station) contains a higher dose of it.  So my first piece of 
advice is to spend a few cents more per gallon and fill your tank with Top Tier gas. 
If you can't find a station that carries Top Tier gas (search for one at 
toptiergas.com) and you make a lot of short runs or drive in stop-and-go traffic, 
you may get better gas mileage and improve engine performance by adding a fuel 
system cleaner to your tank.  Chevron Techron and CRC Guaranteed to Pass fuel 
system cleaners cost less than $13 and do a very good job.  There's no need to 
spend more than that on a fuel system cleaner.  Just add a bottle to your tank 
once every 3,000 miles and your engine will thank you."</p>

<p>"If you drive a diesel, Marvel Diesel Supplement or STP Diesel Fuel Treatment 
will clean the fuel system and lubricate the injectors.  They'll also reduce the 
risk of fuel waxing during cold weather."</p>

<p>Caution: Read the bottle instructions for dosing amounts.  Add the cleaners 
directly to the fuel tank.</p>

<p>Techron can sometimes be found at WalMart for around $7.</p>

<hr>
<p><b>OIL ADDITIVES</b></p>

<p>"Skip any oil additives unless you have an old car (early '80s or older).  Those 
engines were built with high-friction flat tappet lifters, so they need a boost of 
anti-wear additive with ZDDP (zinc dialkyl dithio phosphate).  Supplemental ZDDP 
additives cost less than $15 a bottle.  Shop for brands like ZDDP Plus or Hy-Per 
Lube Zinc.  Don't use ZDDP additives with a post-'80s engine - extra ZDDP can 
damage your catalytic converter."</p>

<p>"Hoping to restore your worn engine to "like new" condition with a restorative 
additive?  Dream on - it's just not going to happen.  The same holds true for oil 
treatments that contain Teflon or other ingredients that claim to reduce friction 
and wear.  Save your cash for something more beneficial, such as regular oil and 
filter changes."</p>

<hr>
<p><b>TRANSMISSION ADDITIVES</b></p>

<p>"If your transmission is slow to shift or reluctant to go into gear, and has 
plenty of fluid, it's most likely ready to give up the ghost.  If you're a gambler, 
you can try a transmission "fix-in-bottle" additive.  It may buy you a few more 
months of driving (at best).  But don't think you've fixed the problem.  Your 
transmission is going to fail and probably sooner rather than later."</p>

<p>"If your transmission shifts well but leaks fluid, you can add a transmission 
leak-stop product.  They work by swelling the seals to slow the leak.  But they're 
not a permanent fix.  Eventually you'll have to replace the leaky seals or 
gaskets."</p>

<p>"For older transmissions with no shifting problems, add a bottle of a fluid 
conditioner like LubeGard, Prolong, or Lucas Transmission Fix (about $10).  It 
bolsters the performance of older nonsynthetic transmission fluids.  You don't 
need a conditioner of you're driving a late-model vehicle with the newer long-life 
synthetic transmisison fluids like Mercon V, Dexron VI, or Chrysler ATF+4."</p>

<hr>
<p><b>COOLING SYSTEM ADDITIVES</b></p>

<p>"If you notice coolant puddles on your driveway, check for a cracked radiator 
or heater hose or a loose hose clamp.  Repair that first.  Next, check for a 
leaking core plug (also called a freeze plug).  Core plugs are cheap and easy 
to replace if you can access the area easily.  But if it turns out your leak is 
coming from your radiator, heater core, or an inaccessible core plug, try adding 
a cooling system sealer product like Bar's Leaks No. PLT11 or Gunk C312 ($5 at 
auto parts stores).  If the product seals the leak, great.  If not, you haven't 
lost much money.  Just remember to add another dose of sealer next time you change 
your coolant. If sealer doesn't work, you'll have to bite the bullet and replace 
the leaking component."</p>

<p>"If your vehicle is overheating, forget about pouring in an additive (such as a 
wetting agent) to stop the overheating.  None of them work.  You'll waste your 
money and risk permanent engine damage (a minimum $1000 repair) simply by driving 
around waiting to see if the additive works.  Just fork over the dough to fix the 
underlying cooing problem."</p>

<p>"Another product to avoid is water pump lubricants.  Fresh coolant does a fine 
job of lubricating the water pump."</p>

<p>Caution: Add stop leak products directly to the radiator.  If your vehicle 
doesn't have a radiator cap, remove the upper hose, siphon out some coolant and 
pour the additive into the radiator with a funnel.</p>

<hr>
<p><b>HEAD GASKET SEALERS</b></p>

<p>"If you constantly have to top off your coolant but can't find any sign of an 
external leak, you probably have a leaking head gasket.  Skip the inexpensive ($15 
or less) head gasket sealers (they require at least two full days of water-flushing 
procedures).  Instead, spend the extra bucks for Bar's Leaks HG-1 Head Gasket &amp; 
Cooling Sealant ($45) or K&W; FiberLock Head Gasket &amp; Block Repair 
(No. 401224-6; $35)."</p>

<p>"There's an important caveat to using any head gasket sealer.  Your engine must 
be able to run for about 20 minutes without overheating or losing its coolant.  If 
your engine overheats right away or loses coolant too fast, forget about a head 
gasket sealer - the cylinder head is probably warped.  That'll require machine 
shop service and a new gasket.  If the head gasket sealer works, you don't need 
to add new sealer when you change your coolant."</p>

<p>Caution: Pour the head gasket sealer directly into the radiator and run the 
engine for the specified period shown on the label.</p>
