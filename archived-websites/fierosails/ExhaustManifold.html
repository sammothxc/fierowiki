<p>The exhaust manifolds in the 2.5L Fiero are found in several other GM
cars but the manifolds in the 2.8L Fiero are unique. Unfortunately the
2.8L manifolds are prone to cracking and leakage.  Repair by welding or
replacement with used exhaust manifolds are the only options with a
2.8L engine (other than aftermarket performance headers or exhaust pipe 
modifications).  If you are willing to make customized exhaust piping, manifolds 
from many 2.8/3.1/3.4 engine will bolt to the Fiero heads.  Note that the Fiero 
manifolds are stainless steel.</p>

<p>That said, there is one set of cast iron exhaust manifolds that will bolt to the 
2.8L Fiero which requires only minor modification to the downstream exhaust piping.  
These are the manifolds from the 1989/90 Grand Prix Turbo (Turbo ONLY).  The Fiero 
Y-pipe requires bending to match the manifolds and this can be done using a vice 
and a 2" pipe for additional leverage.  A benefit of using the Grand Prix manifolds 
is reduced noise in the cockpit.</p>

<p>
A company called AM Autoparts (am-autoparts.com) lists a new manifold for the Fiero 
2.5L engine for about $100 (March 2010) with free shipping.

<p><b>Exhaust Manifold Bolts, 2.8L</b></p>
<p>We'll say it up front: Replacement bolts for the 2.8L exhaust manifold are available 
as Dorman Part No. 03411. It is a set of 10 studs with locking nuts for Ford V8s.  Typically 
available at auto parts stores - ask for them by number.

Blazer will fit the '87-88 Fiero 4 cylinder engine but we have not been 
able to confirm this.
