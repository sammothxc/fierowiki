<p>The Fiero antenna is a fixed-mount wire that is
common to many GM vehicles of the same vintage. The antenna base is
threaded making it simple to remove/install. Replacement antennas for
all years can be found at auto parts stores under the "Champ" brand,
part number 9-1518. Used antennas are readily available in salvage
yards.</p>

<p>Electric antennas can be mounted to the Fiero with a little work. An
example is at www.fierosails.com/ElectricAntenna.html
