</font><p><hr></p>
<font face="Courier"><p>Approximately eight bulb types cover all lamps used in the 
Fiero. Alternatives exist for many of the bulbs which are improvements over
the originals. LED (light emitting diode) replacements are becoming popular for tail 
lights and turn signals but we are unaware of any that are approved by the DOT (US Department of 
Transportation). We have seen relacement LEDs that fit a few bulbs of cars other than 
the Fiero and with time we expect to see some that will fit the Fiero, too.</p>

<p>One location which is suitable for LED replacements is the third brake light in 
'85-88 Fieros. We are unaware of any aftermarket replacements at this time.</p>
<p>Use of LED lights for turn signals usually requires special flasher units; they 
are not plug &amp; play.</p>

<p>Note 1:</b> We understand that Levine Auto Parts (http://www.levineautoparts.com/27009headlamp.html) makes 
a high-brightness headlamp replacement that works well on the Fiero.  It is a bit pricey but reputedly is of
high quality.</p>

<p><b>Note 2:</b> We understand that #194 bulbs (2 candle power) can be replaced with #168 bulbs 
(3 candle power) for a little more brightness. We have not verified this swap.</p>

<b><p>Note 3:</b> We understand that #194PC (1/2" size) are the #194 bulb with "twist-in" socket which fit the instrument panel 
behind the speedometer, tach, "check engine", and other warning lights.</p>

<b><p>Note 4:</b> We understand that Xenon bulb 9732 is a direct fit for the 168 and 194 bulbs.  
It is a 5 watt bulb and not suitable for all Fiero applications due to heat, but it makes a 
suitable replacement for the side marker lights, "Pontiac" rear lights, courtesy lights, and 
cargo area lignt.  Due to their extra heat, make sure the bulbs are not too close to anything 
that would be easily affected.  Bulbs are available at lighting stores as well as 
on-line at seagulllighting.com.
