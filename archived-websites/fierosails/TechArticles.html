        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have 
        collected a few technical articles over the years that you might find as 
        useful and/or interesting as we did.  They are courtesy of Kit Car 
        Magazine and Car Craft Magazine in the late '90s, and Family Handyman from 
        February 2012.  As thanks to these 
        magazines we encourage you to visit their web sites (links below) and 
        support their organizations. They have a great selection of articles and 
        information in their archives that apply directly to Fieros as well as 
        your mom's grocery-getter.  For example, who wouldn't want to know the 
        techniques of making faded paint look nearly new again?  Check the links
        and do some digging.</p>

INSIDE ALTERNATORS</p></font>

<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<p><p>The little red light on your dash reminds you that something might be wrong with 
your alternator.  Before you get talked into replacing it for big bucks, read this two-page 
article and learn how they really work.  Perhaps replacing a few alternator parts won't 
be so intimidating.  And if you want to upgrade your alternator to put out more power, you 
will have a better idea of how to handle it.</p>

PERFORMANCE TIRES</p></font>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<p><p>Nothing affects ride and handling more than tires.  To get the best of both 
these aspects a proper performance tire will make all the difference.  Read this 
four-page article 
to decide what's best for your particular wheels, what you should consider for tire height 
and width, and even what tread pattern is best for your driving habits.

ENGINE TURNING</p></font>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<p><p>Have you ever seen the engine cowling on the Spirit of St. Louis? Or perhaps the 
instrument panel of a Cord or the firewall of a vintage Bugatti? If yes, you have seen 
a classic example of engine turning, the metalworking technique that leaves a series 
of overlapping circular engraving on metal.  The effect is striking and can be done in a 
home shop with basic tools.  The Fiero has many interior surfaces where this technique 
could be applied.  Learn how from this two-page article.

FIERO MERA</p></font>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<p><p>Not every Fiero left the showroom with the familar body style we all know.  Some Fieros 
looked unmistakably like the Ferrari driven by 'Magnum PI'! That's the Mera.  Find out how this happened to 
the '87 and '88 Fieros.  And keep your eyes open; they are still on the road and 
sometimes show up for sale.

turn one of them into a kit car with new body panels and interior.  Find out how to go 
about it wisely in this two-page summary.

<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<p><p>You now have the Fiero looking like a new dime and with all the work you put in, the 
value is more than your regular car insurer says it is.  Yet to get it on the road you 
obviously need insurance.  Find out how to get insured for replacement value yet keep from
