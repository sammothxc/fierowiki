<p><b>Dash Speakers:</b>	All model Fieros used the same dash speakers, 10 Ohm 4"
x 10" Delco units.  As far as we can determine, the vehicles below used
the same speakers somewhere in the vehicle.  Note that Fieros which had
"Premium Sound" (sub woofer option) had different speakers than other
Fieros.  A minimal amount of data on the "premium sound" speakers is shown below.  
("Premium Sound" is the option which includes a separate amplifier and subwoofer
system.)

<p>The original Fiero speakers are 10 ohm impedance.  For optimum life on the 
factory radio/amplifier you should use 10 ohm replacements.  Use of 8 ohm speakers 
or worse, 4 ohm speakers, will cause the amplifier to run hotter for the equivalent 
sound level as a 10 ohm speaker.  If you do not run your radio/stereo at full volume, 
use of speakers which are not 10 ohm impedance should not make much difference.</p>

<p>We have read that the '98 and newer Chevy Tahoe and Chevy Suburban have 4 x 10 rear 
speakers which will transfer easily to the Fiero and work well.  We do not have 
personal experience with this swap.</p>

<p>A same-size inexpensive replacement for the dash speaker is available
under the brand name "Linear Research", Stock Number LR410S.  This is a
Chinese-made speaker which is advertised as 75 Watts nominal, dual cone,
for 4-8 Ohm systems.  This has been used successfully even though the
OEM speakers are 10 Ohm impedance.  We suggest the Linear Research
speakers are not a good choice with high-power amplifiers but they do
work with standard Fiero radio/tape players and would be a reasonable
choice when repairing a car for purposes of sale.  We have seen these
speakers available at Pep Boys for around $15.  The distributor is Recoton
Company, 1090 Emma Oaks Trail, Lake Mary, FL 32746, (800) 732-6866.

<p>There are many good quality <b>aftermarket speakers</b> such as Kenwood
KFC-451C, Pioneer TSA-4103/4105 and AutoBahn AS41Q at about $100 a pair.
 The "Eclipse" brand is also reputed to be a good choice as are the Polk 
 MOMO line, although the Polk units were discontinued in 2007 and may only be 
 found on places like eBay.  The Pyle PLG41.3 4"x10" Triaxial Speaker Pair is 
 reportedly a very good replacement at around $33/pair plus shipping.  Speakers are
available at most audio shops and via the Internet at sites such as
crutchfield.com and cardiscountstereos.com.  Some speakers will come
with plugs requiring an adapter or will need the wiring soldered or
mechanically spliced.  See the heading "Speaker Connections" below in
this regard.

<p>If you have the "premium sound option", the speakers are two-way units 
and provide better sound quality than the conventional OEM speaker.  As of April 2005, 
replacement two-way dash speakers are available from GM Parts Direct for $27.44 each; 
the part number is 16042082.  Unfortunately we do not have the part number for the 
companion sail panel speakers.

<hr>
<b>'86-88 B-Pillar Spkr.:</b> The speakers in the B-pillars (also
referred to as the "sail panel" speakers) are 4" x 6" and there are at
least a dozen speakers made that will fit.  The Rockford Fosgate
FRC3246,  Pioneer TS-4667, Kenwood KFC-4675, and AudoBahn AS46Q are some
examples.

<hr>
<b>'84-85 Headrest Spkr.:</b> The headrest speakers were a feature in
'84-85 Fieros only.  They are 3.5" diameter with 10 Ohm impedence.  Many companies make a 3.5" speaker which can
replace the originals and we have even seen them on blister packs in Wal Mart.
Four speakers are required (two per seat) if a
complete replacement is performed.  Infinity, Polk, JBL, and AudoBahn
are some of the manufacturers who make 3.5" speakers.  The Sony Mobile XS-W3521 and 
Clearwater CWC-3D are 3.5" speakers which have both been sold on eBay as replacements 
for the Fiero (and Miata) headrest speakers.  We have no personal experience with either 
but both have favorable comments on Fiero forums.  A 4" speaker can be made to fit the headrest by trimming 
the surrounding foam.  Information for adding headrest speakers can be found at 
this link: http://mrmikes.com/fierospeakers.htm




<hr>
<b>Sub woofer:</b> The 5.25" speaker in the factory "Premium Sound" sub
woofer is prone to failure due to age.  The speaker frequently fails at
the flex joint between the paper cone and the speaker frame.  This
usually can be repaired at less than the cost of a new speaker.

<p>If a new speaker is desired, JL Audio makes one but we don't have the
part number.  Radio Shack makes a 5.25" Woofer (#40-1032) for about
$20.  Its wattage is 30 RMS, 60 peak, effective range 80-8,000 Hz, but we do 
not know the impedance and it may not be a good match for the amplifier.  You
will need to use  some spacing material at the four mounting screws if this 
speaker is used.  Sub woofer speakers can also be obtained at rodneydickman.com for about $35-40.

<p><b>Speaker Connections: </b>If you are working on speakers, note that the
terminals labeled "A" and "B" on Delco speakers are - and +, respectively.

<p>When using aftermarket speakers you may want adapters to connect the new speakers 
without resorting to cutting, splicing, or soldering.  If so, you will need plug-in 
adapters to match the new speaker connections with the Fiero connector.  In December of 
2008 the following adapters were found using a web search.  We have not verified these 
personally and you should check carefully to make sure they match both the old connector 
and new speakers:

From Circuitcity.com, Item number MET DW4500SH, $12.99/pair
From Crutchfield.com, Item number 12071009, $9.99/pair
From GDIElectronics.com, Metra part number 724500, $4.62/pair
