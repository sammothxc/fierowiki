<p>Several radio models were used in the Fiero. Listing all the
variations and the cars which used corresponding radios is pointless
since OEM and aftermarket replacements are readily available.  (For a
used radio, check late '80s GM cars in any salvage yard.)  One of the
options available was "Premium Sound" with a sub woofer.  As far as we
can determine no other vehicle used the same sub woofer system so replacements
will have to come from a donor Fiero.

<p>Newer GM radios which will fit the Fiero and maintain the factory look
can be found in salvage yards and via the Internet.  The radio/CD unit
from early '90s Pontiac Pontiac Grand Ams is a popular choice.  Wiring
adapters or modification of the connectors is required.  If radios are
salvaged from other cars be sure any security features can be bypassed. 
The Fiero radio size is "1.5 DIN".  Many aftermarket radios are made to
this size and will fit with few modifications.
