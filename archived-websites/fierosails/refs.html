Thanks for the Sail Panels. They look like factory-made accessories!  To be honest,
we didn't think they would turn out this great ... Great response time!  If you need any references on this design please feel [free] to hand out my name.  The Pontiac Racing logo looks so good they look like they came directly from Pontiac.  Kudos. </font></p>

        add me to your reference list.  I purchased a set of sail panels for my 
        '88 Formula in March of 2000 and after taking it out of storage last week, 
        I noticed some delaminating of the paint. After emailing Paul and explaining 
        the situation he immediately said he was sorry for the problem and would 
        ship me another set immediately. I received them today, just 3 days after 
        emailing him 'NO CHARGE'. He is great to deal with and I just wish more 
        people selling there products were as great. We could all have better 
        Fieros". Thanks Bob Lesko, Johnson City, NY (rlesko@stny.rr.com) </font></p>

        recommend you &amp; your products without reservation. Its been a rare pleasure."</font></p>

        McKibben Sail Panels (QTR Windows) Evaluation Report<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"If you own 
        an '85-'88 Fiero notchback it is not a question of if you will need to 
        replace your quarter windows or sail panels, it is a question of when. 
        I own 4 Fieros and the panels are going on three of them. This is because 
        of age from being exposed to extremes of humidity, heat, cold and other 
        environmental factors. They become brittle and often crack. If you are 
        lucky and they don't crack the paint will sometimes flake off the back 
        and of course scratches are common. Car washes really don't help matters 
        either, especially when alcohol based cleaners like Windex are used to 
        clean them. Over the course of a few years, these parts end up looking 
        plain cruddy. So what is the solution??? Paul McKibben of GA. has been 
        manufacturing replacement Fiero sail panels for quite a few months now 
        and I have heard only good things about them. Having acquired one of Paul's 
        panels for evaluation I set out to judge the fit, finish and overall quality. 
        I had the pleasure to evaluate a sail panel with a custom look. The panel 
        is black with a Pegasus logo. However, for those desiring the exact OEM 
        look, Paul also offers panels with SE, &amp; GT logos in addition to clear 
        ones, all black panels and a panel with the "Formula" script on it. So 
        how good are these panels? In one word excellent. We checked the fit in 
        the sail panel frame and the fit was perfect. The graphic image (logo) 
        was sharp and clear and appeared to be heat stamped from the back of the 
        panel. The shine and black color of the panel also matched the original 
        Fiero panel perfectly. Having seen and evaluated Paul McKibben's sail 
        panels first hand, it is easy to notice that the craftsmanship is top 
        notch. Paul has apparently duplicated the original panels perfectly and 
        they are very easy to install. In fact they look so much like the original 
        OEM panels that I doubt if an expert show judge could tell the difference." 
        </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"OEM sail 
        panels are now getting harder to find and are expensive. The panels with 
        the GT logo are particularly hard to find. McKibben's sail panels now 
        offer a solution. In short this is an outstanding product at a moderate 
        price. Great job Paul. If there were a best new Fiero product of the year 
        award these parts would certainly be in the running." </font></p>

        say that I agree completely! [with Dennis LaGrua] I recently purchased 
        some sail panels and I am very pleased with the end result. Paul had a 
        pair of SE sail panels ready to go and shipped them to me without even 
        receiving payment! He communicated with me well via e-mail and was an 
        overall pleasure to do business with. His prices are extremely fair when 
        compared to buying a whole new sail elsewhere. Installation was straight 
        forward and went smoothly. If you are in need of repairing your cracked 
        panels, please drop Paul an e-mail. He is definetly an asset to the Fiero 
        community! </font></p>

        to work on them with them still on the car, using extreme caution not 
        to let any chemicals get on the car paint (it's going in for a paint job 
        soon anyway). Once I had the old panel off, I used a small rag (for better 
        control) soaked with a printer's solvent (I work as a printer) Varn V-120 
        and then used a putty knife to remove the old adhesive. You can only remove 
        a little at a time but it took about 30 minutes per panel to remove, nice 
        and clean. I attached the panels which worked out great. The craftsmanship 
        was excellent and the fit was beyond compare. Thank you for the service."
