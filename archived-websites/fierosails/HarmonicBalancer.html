<p>
<b>Harmonic Balancer:</b>  The harmonic balancer for the V-6 has been
discontinued by GM but part number  14085401 will fit if the timing
marks from your old harmonic balancer are transferred carefully to the
new one.  Don't try to use the timing marks on the new balancer; they
are 60 degrees off!

<p>We have no information on harmonic balancers for the 4 cylinder Fiero
other than the aftermarket version shown below.  Since so many 4
cylinder engines were used on other cars the balancers are probably
still available from GM.  It is also reasonable to assume that if an engine
will swap into a Fiero (see the "Engine" section), so will the harmonic
balancer from that engine.

<p>A harmonic balancer for the 2.8L V6 (or any engine) can be obtained from the 
Damper Doctor, http://members.aol.com/damperdoc/.  Their dampers are rebuilt with 
new parts where needed and the timing mark correctly placed.  Quality is 
reported to be excellent.

<p>Some aftermarket balancers for the Fiero are shown below.

<p>
<br>Harmonic Balancer, 2.5L, '87-88  Dorman 594-027
<br>Harmonic Balancer, 2.8L, '85-87  Dorman 594-013
<br>Harmonic Balancer, 2.8L, '88&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dorman 594-008

<p> And these:
<p>
<br>From Auto Zone for Fiero V6 (in 2002):
<br>Pioneer DA-1731 (replaces OE# 14083394) 73.99
<br>Pioneer DA-1733 (replaces OE# 14085401) 67.99

<p><p>1 year warranty on them.  Auto Zone only sells new balancers.
