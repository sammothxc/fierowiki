<p>
<b>FAN &amp; MOTOR:</b>	Five different fan motors and four different fans
were used in the Fiero during its lifetime and replacements for all of
them are easily available.  So many GM cars used the same fan and motor
we are not taking the space to list them.

<p>We understand that an aftermarket fan made by Spal Automotive will work
well in the Fiero with slight modification.  You must cut the four
arms that hold the original fan and motor flush with the shroud so the
Spal will fit.  The fan is very well balanced, has a low power draw, and
moves about twice as much air as the stock Fiero fan.  The fan is a 16
inch Spal Model Number SPA30100231 and is available from Spal at
www.spal-usa.com/html/spalhome.htm

<p>We also understand that many 16" fans on newer vehicles can be
modified to work on the Fiero and that doing so will provide benefits of 
higher fan efficiency and lower current draw.
