<font color="#000000" face="Courier" size="+0">

</font><p><font color="#000000" face="Courier" size="+0">Sometimes it is necessary to consult the list of "option codes" on your Fiero to 
determine which specific parts it contained as-built by the factory. For example, 
it is difficult to know the capacity of an alternator by looking at it. The list of 
option codes (also called RPO or Regular Production Option codes) provides this 
information. The option codes are printed on a sticker called the "Service Parts 
Identification Label" located on the left front fender well next to the spare tire. 
(This label is often referred to as the "RPO Tag" or "RPO Label".) Here is what 
the codes mean:</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Courier" size="+0"><b>WA-NNNN</b> (N = any number) code on the bottom of the RPO tag is the Fisher Body "WA" paint 
number. (Fisher Body is the division of GM that produced and painted the car body.) Use 
this number when buying equivalent paint from any paint supplier. Touch-up paint suppliers 
such as PlastiKote and Dupli-Color also use this number as a cross-reference. Use the 
cross-reference manual found by the paint display in your auto parts store to obtain the 
correct spray can or bottle for your car.
</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" face="Courier" size="+0">Note that the two digit numbers in the above list (14, 18, 40, 81, etc.) are also paint 
codes. Some GM cross-references use this number also. If you see something like "81U/16L" 
it means the upper portion of the Fiero is "81" or Bright Red and the lower portion of 
the car (ground effects) is "16", Silver Metallic.
