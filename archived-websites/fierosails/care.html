      <p>Sail panels 
        are made of acrylic sheet similar to Plexiglas. (Plexiglas is a registered 
        trade mark.) Information about the longevity, care, and cleaning of the 
        acrylic sheet is provided below. The information is from a 1994 publication 
        entitled "Plexiglas" by Atohass Corporation, a licensee of Rohm and Haas 
        Company.</p>
      <p><b>LONGEVITY:</b> 
        Plexiglas has a proven ability to withstand the effects of weather, sun, 
        and a wide range of temperatures in outdoor use. In tests performed in 
        Arizona, Florida, and Pennsylvania, samples of Plexiglas sheet exposed 
        for 20 years or more show no significant discoloration, crazing, surface 
        dulling, or development of haze or turbidity. The test samples were mounted 
        on outdoor racks at a 45 degree angle facing south.</p>

      <p><b>CLEANING:</b> 
        Plexiglas will scratch easily and a common-sense approach must be used 
        to keep it looking good. To clean Plexiglas, wash with plenty of non-abrasive 
        soap or detergent and water. Use a bare hand to feel and dislodge any 
        caked dirt or mud. A soft, grit-free cloth, sponge, or chamois may be 
        used, but only as a means of carrying water to the sheet. Do not use hard, 
        rough cloths that will scratch. Dry with a clean, damp, chamois. Grease 
        and oil may be removed with kerosene or aliphatic naphtha (no aromatic 
        content).</p>

      <p>For obvious 
        reasons, DO NOT USE A PRESSURE WASHER AROUND SAIL PANELS. This WILL cause 
        them to pop loose.</p>

      <p>DO NOT USE 
        WINDOW SPRAYS OR KITCHEN SCOURING COMPOUNDS to clean Plexiglas. Also do 
        not use solvents such as acetone, dry-cleaning fluid, lacquer thinners, 
        alcohol, etc., since they attack the Plexiglas surface. Alcohol solutions 
        containing more than 10% alcohol or cresylic acid germicides may attack 
        and harm the Plexiglas surface. Strong alkali solutions (lye, ammonium 
        hydroxide, etc.) can be used freely on Plexiglas, but may damage automobile 
        paints.</p>
      <p><b>HAND POLISHING:</b> 
        Most minor scratches can be removed or reduced by application of polish. 
        To apply polishes, use a small pad of soft cotton flannel dampened with 
        water. Rub the sheet along the length of the scratches with a back and 
        forth or circular motion. Avoid excess rubbing in one spot. Several applications 
        may be necessary, but most minor scratches can be reduced and the clarity 
        improved within a short time. When scratches are removed or reduced, consider 
        the application of wax or anti-static coating.</p>
      <p><b>WAXING:</b> 
        If, after removing dirt and grease, no great amount of scratching is visible, 
        coat the Plexiglas with a good grade of commercial wax. This will improve 
        the appearance by filling minor scratches. The wax should be applied in 
        a thin, even coat and brought to a high luster by rubbing lightly with 
        a dry, soft cloth such as cotton flannel, outing flannel, or flannelette. 
        EXCESSIVE RUBBING WITH A DRY CLOTH WILL CAUSE SCRATCHES.</p>

      <p><b>PAINT 
        REMOVAL:</b> If you paint around your car, mask the sail panels or better yet, remove them entirely.  If you 
        get overspray on them, soak the painted part in a 10% - 20% solution of 
        lye or trisodium phosphate. (Do not get this on the car paint.) Wallpaper 
        paste can be mixed with these solutions to make a paste that will cling 
        to vertical surfaces. Paints which have an acrylic resin base CANNOT be 
        removed from Plexiglas with this method, and this includes many automobile 
        paints.</p>
