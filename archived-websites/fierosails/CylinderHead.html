<p><font face="Courier">The following information was posted to Pennock's Fiero Forum by "Ray", Houston, TX:</p>

<p>Better flowing heads for an '87-88 Fiero 2.5L are found on the '90-93 S-10, S-15 and Blazer.  Using these heads requires transferring the intake manifold with the heads, but all other parts from the Fiero will bolt on directly.  Changing the heads/intake provides a bit more horsepower and better mileage.  The exhaust ports on the newer heads are smaller than those on the Fiero but are more efficient.  The combustion chambers are different and provide better fuel/air mixing and better cooling.</p></font>

<font face="Courier">
<p>Fiero owner Steve Steel researched the 2.8L cylinder heads trying to determine the 
difference represented by the two identification numbers.  
Here is what he found out from New Jersey Cylinder Head Co.:</p>
 
<p>"The two casting numbers (879, 884) are identical heads.  The manufactures change the casting numbers every once in a 
while even though they are producing the same castings.  Those casting numbers are 100% compatible with each other 
along with casting numbers 227/327.  They will fit a 2.8L and a 3.1L GM engine from '85-94 that uses that style cast 
iron head."</p>
