<p><hr>

<font face="Courier"> Manual transmissions were offered for the Fiero in
all production years.  In 1984 only a four-speed transmission was
offered but it came in two versions, one of which is referred to as the
"Econo" model.  The final gear ratio on this transmission was 3.32:1 to
provide optimum mileage for the four-cylinder engine.  Only a few
thousand of these were offered.  A 1984 Fiero containing the Econo
four-speed will have "MY8" on the RPO (Regular Production Option) Code
sticker located on the left front fender well.  An "econo" transmission 
can be identified when out of the car by "NA" or "DJ" stamped on the bell 
housing.  The other transmission which had a final ratio of 4.10:1 is identified 
by "UM" or "DW" stamped on the bell housing.

<p>In 1985 the four-speed transmission was offered only on the V-6
engine.  The four-cylinder engine came with a five-speed Isuzu.

<p> In 1986 the four-speed was used on the V-6 until about mid-year when
it was replaced by the five-speed Muncie 282 "Getrag".  The five-speed
Isuzu continued to be used with the four-cylinder engine.  The latter
two transmissions continued to be used on the V-6 and four-cylinder
engines respectively in 1987-88, although some gearing changes occurred
on the Isuzu. The Isuzu transmissions can be swapped in all '85-88
Fieros realizing that minor gearing changes may occur.

<b>'86-88 2.8L 5-speed "Getrag":</b> This exact transmission is unique to the
Fiero. According to the Hollander manual, five-speed transmissions
from the cars below can be used if the shift arm is rotated 180 degrees.
However Rodney Dickman (rodneydickman.com) advises this information is
incorrect.  Rodney makes a hardware kit which will allow these transmissions to
be used with the Fiero.  Transmissions which will work are:
<pre>
   Cadillac Cimarron  '87-88  gear driven speed sensor
   Chevrolet Beretta  '87-89  2.8L gear driven speed sensor
   Chevy Cavalier        '87  2.8L five speed, w/electronic speedometer
   Chevy Cavalier     '88-89  2.8L electronic speedometer
   Chevy Celebrity    '87-88  gear driven speed sensor
   Chevy Corsica      '87-89  2.8L gear driven speed sensor
   Pontiac 6000       '87-88  gear driven speed sensor
   Pontiac Tempest    '87-89  2.8L gear driven speed sensor
</pre>
<p> Five-speed Getrag transmissions from the cars below can be used in the
'86-88 2.8L 5-speed Fiero by switching the speed sensor, shift arm,
and/or speedometer cable.  The shift arm must use the Rodney Dickman kit to work.
<pre>
   Cadillac Cimarron  '87-88  cable drive speedometer
   Chevy Cavalier        '87  2.8L five speed w/cable drive speedometer
   Chevy Cavalier     '88-89  2.8L cable drive speedometer
   Olds Firenza          '87  2.8L five speed
</pre>

<p>Other 1987-94 GM cars (Pontiac Grand Prix, Pontiac Grand Am, etc.) used
a similar Getrag 5-speed transmission but the linkage system for the
slave cylinder and release arm is different than the Fiero.  On these
transmissions the release arm is inside the transmission and the slave
cylinder mounts to the bell housing.  Rodney Dickman offers an adapter
that allows this version of the Getrag 5-speed to be used in the Fiero.
<p>
<b>"Shift" and "Select" cables</b> for Fiero manual transmissions can be
obtained from California Push-Pull (push-pull.com) and
rodneydickman.com.
