<h1 align="CENTER">TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS</h1>
</font>
<p><font face="Courier">
In this section we list the Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) that have been issued 
by GM which are deemed to apply to the Fiero.  GM issues lots of  TSBs.  TSBs are 
recommended repair or maintenance procedures 
specifically addressed to GM mechanics and service personnel. Do not confuse a TSB 
with a recall.  A recall has government-mandated provisions that relate to safety 
which must be observed for specific vehicles.  GM and the US government make recall 
information freely available to the public, but GM is under no obligation to share 
TSBs.  In fact TSBs are copyrighted and cannot be freely published.  Thus we do 
not have specific wording from TSBs on this web site.  All we have is the general 
description of the TSB as provided by AllData 
(http://www.alldatadiy.com/TSB/48/88481211.html).</p>

<p>If you are interested in reading a specific TSB, you can purchase it on-line 
via AllData, you can get it from your friendly local GM dealer (maybe), or in some 
cases, you can get it via your local library.</p>

<p>Any specific TSB on the list may apply to many GM cars besides the Fiero.  Some of 
the TSBs will not apply to the Fiero and we do not know why AllData (the source of 
our information) included them.  (I.e. - "Power Antenna Will Not Retract".)  
Nevertheless, we have maintained the list in its entirety.</p>

<p>Below is the alphabetic listing of 336 TSBs published as of April 2010.  We find many of them 
intriguing and wish we had specific information that we could share.</p>
