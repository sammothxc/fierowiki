<font face="Courier"> 

<p>The turn signal stalk on the Fiero varied with certain options such
as windshield wiper controls and cruise control.  Equivalent stalks
were used on many GM cars of the same era. OEM replacements with delay
wipers and cruise are still available under part number 25111290,
although they are flat black instead of shiny.  Aftermarket units are
also available, typically in the "Help" brand of parts.  A turn signal
cam (a part that's inside the steering column and wears out with age)
listed for all Fieros is Help! 49303.
