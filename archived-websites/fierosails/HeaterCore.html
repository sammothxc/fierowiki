<p><b>HEATER CORE:</b>	Two heater cores were used in the Fiero, one
for cars with air conditioning, another for cars without.  See photo below. The core 
size is the same for all years but for cars with A/C the inlet/outlet pipes on the 
heater core are longer and offset.  The heater cores are unique and not used in other 
vehicles so the only source for salvaged units is another Fiero.  Aftermarket units 
are readily available from chain auto parts stores such as AutoZone, Rock Auto, etc., 
as well as places such as Auto Radiator Outlet at 800-252-0333.  The AC Delco heater 
core part number for an '84-88 Fiero with A/C is 15-60038.</p>

<p>
A company called Ready-Aire (factory is in Mexico) makes a replacement heater core for 
Fieros <font color="RED"><b>with A/C</b></font> that works fine.  We have used it successfully in our two Fieros.  
This particular core is stocked by several companies under their specific part number 
as follows:<br>
<pre>
Ready-Aire      398203
Fedco            2-469
NAPA              3310
Four Seasons     94498
Everco            6201
Stant            90203
Murray          279157
</pre>
<p>
As of 12/10/08 we found the heater core at rockauto.com for $45.89 using the 
Four Seasons part number 94498.  We also found it at advanceauto.com for $46.99 and 
at autozone.com for $41.99 under the Ready-Aire number 398203.
</p>

<p>If the heater core cannot be replaced it usually can be repaired by a competent 
radiator shop.</p>

<p><b>When removing a leaky heater core</b> the hoses will often be bonded to the 
inlet and outlet pipes making it very difficult to remove the hoses without 
damaging them.  Since the heater core will be replaced anyway, we suggest you use 
pliers, Vise Grips, etc., to squeeze the hoses at the inlet/outlet pipes, thus 
crushing the pipes beneath the hose and breaking the bond.  You may need to 
crush the hose at 90 degree positions to be effective.  Avoid the use of serrated 
jaws to protect the hoses from damage, or wrap serrated jaws with duct tape, etc., to 
relieve any sharp edges.  With the inlet/outlet pipes crushed, removing the hoses 
without damaging them is a lot easier.

<p>If you plan to replace the heater hoses also, then the fast way to remove the 
heater core is to cut the hoses near the inlet/outlet pipes. 
Just make sure you have replacement hoses in hand <b>before</b> you cut the hoses!
