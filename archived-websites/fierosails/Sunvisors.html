<hr>
<p>The sun visors in a Fiero typically look bad due to deterioration of the material
beneath the outer fabric.  An auto upholstery shop can repair these easily with new 
material.  Typical cost is about $60 a pair.  The sun visors can also be repaired 
with the same fabric used for headliners which can be purchased at fabric shops such 
as JoAnn Fabrics and Hancock Fabrics.</p>

<p>Replacement sun visors with lights that look nearly the same as the Fiero can be 
obtained from a '88-89 Chrysler LeBaron ('90 will work but is slightly different), and 
Dodge Shadow, Daytona, and Sundance.  The power for lighted sun visors can be 
connected to the overhead interior lights.  The sunvisors from these cars seem a bit 
sturdier than those from a Fiero.  We are told that sun visors from late model 
S-series Chevrolet trucks will also work well in the Fiero.</p>
