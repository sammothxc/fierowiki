<p> OK. The information here is not really secret. But some of it is so hard to find that sometimes it seems 
secret. This is a list of Fiero-related web sites, e-mail addresses, and information sources. <font color="RED"> 
You can search it easily with the 'Find' feature of your browser. </font>(742 entries. <b>New stuff added 
18 November '06.</b>) Bookmark this site! </p>Individual links will open in a new window.  Just close the window to return to this page. If you encounter 
sites that are no longer valid or know of sites that could be added to the list please let us know at 
<b>fierosails@yahoo.com</b>. </p>

<p>Say, did you know <b>your temperature gage is wired wrong from the factory?</b>  Fix it easily 
<a href="tempgage.html">HERE</a>.  And if you would like to <b>replace the ragged and dirty engine 
compartment insulation</b>, check out a solution <a href="heatshield.html">HERE</a>.  If you are interested 
in Fiero <font color="Red">Parts</font>, we have a few neat items <a href="paulsphotos.html">Here</a>.  And a new item we have 
in our <a href="decal.html">Decals</a> section is <b>custom artwork for your car cover.</b>  This may sound goofy, 
but check it out before you call us crazy!</p>

<p><b>WAIT!</b> Before you rush off, sign up for the best Fiero List on the Net at
