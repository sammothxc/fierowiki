<h1 align="CENTER">A/C COMPRESSOR &amp; DRYER</h1></font>

<font size="+0" face="Courier" color="000000">

<p>A/C compressors can be rebuilt, exchanged for equivalent
re-manufactured units, or purchased new.  While new is more expensive
than used, we recommend new since it is difficult to determine the
quality of a used compressor by simple inspection.  Installing a used
compressor only to find it is defective is not a pleasant exercise.
</p>

<p>In a nutshell, the compressors which came stock with the Fiero are as 
follows:</p>
<pre>
'84-85 2.5L ---- DA6 or HR6HE
'86    2.5L ----  V5
'87-88 2.5L ----  V5
'85-87 2.8L ---- DA6
'88    2.8L ---- HR6
</pre>

<p>Here is what they look like, although we aren't sure the pulley is correct on the V5:</p>

<a href="images/v5rear.png"><img src="images/v5rear.png" width="252" height="195" border="0"></a>

<p>When purchasing a replacement compressor you will find that parts stores may 
not provide the exact unit that originally came with the Fiero because technology 
has improved, some parts are no longer available, and because of the government 
mandate to use R134-a refrigerant.  Part numbers for replacement compressors are 
as follows:


</p>

<pre>
'84-85 2.5L ---- GM 1136465 or AC Delco 15-20241
'86    2.5L ---- GM 1135192 or AC Delco 15-20084
'87-88 2.5L ---- GM 1135191 or AC Delco 15-20085
'85-88 2.8L ---- GM 1136478 or AC Delco 15-20248
</pre>



<p>Note that '84-85 Fieros were fitted with two different compressors in their
lifetime, the DA6 with a 5.125" pulley and the HR6HE with a 5.75" pulley.  The DA6 is 
obsolete.  If you are replacing an old DA6, use the HR6 which is the 
part number shown above.</p>
<p>A good writeup with information on the compressor high/low pressure switches 
can be found at this link: http://www.fiero.nl/forum/Forum2/HTML/117640.html
<hr/>
<p><b>'84-85 2.5L w/5.75" Pulley:</b> The compressor for this Fiero is the HR6HE
(Harrison Redesigned High Efficiency 6 cylinder).  It is 9.3" long, 4.6"
diameter and weighs 12.6 pounds. The vehicles listed below had the
HR6HE as well as other compressor options, so finding a used compressor may
not be as simple as finding a potential donor vehicle.  In general, an
exact replacement may not be necessary to achieve adequate cooling.  If
a compressor will fit it may be worth trying.</p>

<p><b>'84-85 w/5.125" Pulley:</b> This compressor is the DA6, unique to the '84-85
Fiero. It came with either one or two switches.  If replacement is necessary 
the AC Delco unit listed above is suggested.  In general, an exact
replacement may not be necessary to achieve adequate cooling.  If a
compressor will fit it may be worth trying.
</p>


<hr>
<b>'86 2.5L:</b> This A/C compressor is the GM V5 and is unique to the '86 2.5L Fiero. 
The uniqueness is in the combination of built-in switches and pulley.  The switch on the 
rear of the compressor is plugged and it has a 4.93" pulley.  (Some sources say the pulley
is 5.125".) If replacement is necessary the AC Delco unit listed above is suggested. 
In general, an exact replacement may not be necessary to achieve adequate 
cooling.  If a compressor will fit it may be worth trying.

<hr>
<p><b>'87-88 2.5L:</b> This compressor is the GM V5 and is unique to the '87-88 2.5L
Fiero.  It has a 4.29" pulley (some sources say 4.33") and one switch in the rear of the
compressor.  The following compressors may be worth trying in the '87-88
2.5L Fiero by changing the pulley, clutch, and switches as necessary. 
Some of the donor compressors may have a plug in place of one switch. 
In general, an exact replacement may not be necessary to achieve
adequate cooling.  If a compressor will fit it may be worth trying.</p>

<p>If you want to convert the V5 compressor to R134a, note that it has a control 
valve on the side which should be changed to suit the new refrigerant.  The 
valve can be obtained from a number of sources, notable from A/Ction Air (action-ac.com), 
their part number 31-55302.</p>

<p><b>'85-87 2.8L:</b> There is some confusion on our part
about the compressor for these Fieros.  The Hollander manuals say the
compressor is the HR6HE (Harrison Redesigned High Efficiency 6
cylinder).  The Pontiac "22P" manual refers to the compressor as the
Harrison "DA6" (Downsized Axial 6 cylinder) and we believe the latter to
be correct for the factory-installed unit.  Our research indicates the exterior of 
the two compressors is identical.  Our belief is the HR6HE is a 
recommended upgrade.  The DA6 compressor has two electrical 
connections on the back end.  Note that the DA6 is not considered a good 
candidate for conversion to R134-a refrigerant, probably because of the higher 
pressures encountered.


<p>The vehicles listed below are from Hollander and are in reference to
the HR6HE compressor.  While the compressors originally in the cars below 
were probably not the HR6HE, odds are they had the same original compressor as the Fiero. 
Finding a compressor may not be as simple as finding a potential donor
vehicle.  In general, an exact replacement may not be necessary to
achieve adequate cooling. If a compressor will fit it may be worth
trying.  Compressors from other Fieros are good candidates for swaps,
but brackets my have to be transferred along with the compressor.</p>

<p><b>'88 2.8L:</b> The compressor for this Fiero is the Harrison
HR6 (Harrison Redesigned internally DA6) with a 5.4" pulley.  It is
physically identical to the DA6 with two electrical connections.  It is
a good candidate for conversion to R134-a refrigerant. The AC Delco part 
number for the current replacement compressor is shown above.  Cars which had 
the same original compressor are:
</p>

Buick Skyhawk                  '86 1.8L VIN "J" (8th digit)

<p><b>A/C Dryer (Accumulator), '84:</b> We have no GM part number for the '84 dryer but 
have been advised by Fiero owner Bill Strickland that AutoZone and Parts America 
carry a replacement.  It is Ready-Aire 4370N.  The '84 dryer is the same size and appearance 
as later years.  However the inlet and outlet lines are 180 degrees apart 
and the low pressure cutout port is in the location of the main inlet for dryers used 
in '85-88.  The dryer is available at AutoZone for $12 as of August 2008.

</p>

</p><hr/>

<p><b>A/C Dryer (Accumulator), '85-88:</b> The original GM part number for the '85-88 
dryer is 3059313 but this has been superceded by part number 2724666.  An aftermarket 
version is Factory Air/Four Seasons part number 33181 typically available at Pep
Boys and similar parts stores.  AC Delco part numbers which also work are 
15-1392 and 15-1670.  AutoZone and Parts America have a replacement under their part number
4392N by Ready-Aire.  Old dryers should not be re-used since their ability to remove moisture 
is depleted.
