<p>Wiper motors in the Fiero differed depending on the "intermittent" or
"pulse" action.

<p><b>'84:</b>	Accoring to the Hollander manual, the'84 Fiero did not have a pulse 
wiper.  However Jim Teague, the original owner of an unmodified '84 Fiero, advises 
that his car has an intermittent wiper motor.  So it appears at least some '84 Fieros 
came from the factory with the upgraded motors.  In any case, the cars below
had wiper motors which can swap with the '84 Fiero:
