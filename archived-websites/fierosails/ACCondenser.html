<p> All Fieros use the same A/C condenser.  No other cars used an identical 
condenser.  Aftermarket replacements are available from conventional parts suppliers 
such as The Fiero Store, NAPA, AC-direct.com, and Rock Auto (rockauto.com).  The OEM 
part number is 3050988 and the AC Delco part number is 15-6509.  Depending on where 
you shop, the price is $140 to $270, so look around.</p>
