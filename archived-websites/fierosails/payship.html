      </font> <font size="+0" face="Courier" color="000000"> 
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>PAYMENT</b></font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We accept 
        payment only in U.S. funds via check or postal money order. At this time 
        we do not accept payment by credit card since to do so would increase 
        prices for everyone. PayPal is acceptable if you are willing to absorb 
        the PayPal fee. (PayPal permits charging your purchase to a credit card.) 
        Due to unfavorable experience, we do not ship until your payment has been 
        received. We tell you where to send funds after your order is ready to 
        ship. <b> Note: Listed shipping costs do not include insurance.</b> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There is 
        no express or implied guarantee which accompanies the sail panels. There 
        are too many variables beyond our control to do so (installation methods, 
        environment, care or lack of it, etc.). We certify that all materials 
        used in the sail panels are new and the best quality we can obtain. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If you don't 
        like the sail panel for any reason, send it back in it's ORIGINAL CONDITION 
        within 10 days and we will refund your cost, less shipping expenses. The 
        returned sail panel must be totally without damage. We will be the sole 
        judge of whether or not the panel is returned in damaged condition. (If 
        you put the sail panel on your car, decide you don't like it and return 
        it with adhesive or scratches of any kind, your money will not be refunded.) 
        <b>We do not accept responsibility for shipping damage. That is the purpose 
        of insurance.</b></font></p><br><br>
      <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>SHIPPING</b></font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We use the 
        U.S. Postal Service for shipping. Their "Priority Mail" for one or two 
        sail panels is $6-$12 to most locations in the continental U.S. and generally 
        2 to 4 days for delivery. We do not insure unless requested in advance, 
        and insurance fees are of course added to the cost. The sail panels are 
        rugged and we protect them inside the box with crushed newspaper or styrofoam 
        because it's effective and economical, but damage is still possible.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overnight 
        shipping is available in the continental U.S. but is pricey.  Check usps.com for 
        current rates. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For addresses 
        outside the U.S. we also use the U.S. Postal Service. While we recommend 
        Air Mail, we will be happy to ship via surface at your request. Insurance 
        is additional. Approximate costs for shipping can be determined at usps.com. </font></p>

      
      <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Surface mail 
      to locations outside the U.S. is less expensive but typically takes 5-8 
      weeks to deliver. Air mail is typically 5-7 days. </font></font> </td>
