<b><font face="Courier"><p>BRAKE ROTORS, FRONT</b> </p>
<b><p>'84-87</b> The front brake rotors are unique to the '84-87 Fiero and were not used in other cars. OEM and aftermarket replacements are readily available.</p>

<b><p>'88</b> The front brake rotors are unique to the '88 Fiero and were not used in other cars. GM and aftermarket rotors are available but tend to be expensive. It may be cost effective to move '88 rear rotors to the front. See Brake Rotors, Rear, '88.</p>
</font><p><hr></p>
<b><font face="Courier"><p>BRAKE ROTORS, REAR</b> </p>
<b><p>'84-87</b> The rear brake rotors are unique to the '84-87 Fiero and were not 
used in other cars. OEM and aftermarket replacements are readily available.</p>

<p>If you have an '84-87 Fiero, you can use the front rotor and caliper from a late 
'80s Grand Am.  If you do that you have no parking brake.  You can use the rear 
caliper from an '80-85 Seville with the Grand Am rotor and have a parking brake, but 
you must fabricate a mount for it.

<b><p>'88</b> The rear brake rotors are unique to the '88 Fiero and were not used in 
other cars. OEM and aftermarket rotors are available but can be hard to find and 
expensive. Rear '88 rotors can be replaced by rotors from a '93 Cavalier with 2.2 
SFI engine at a cost of under $20 per rotor. The Cavalier rotors are slightly 
thicker than Fiero rotors and may require the brake pads to be reduced in thickness. 
The Cavalier rotors will not fit the front hub in the '88 Fiero, only the rear. </p>

<p>We have read but cannot confirm that brake rotors for the 1988 Corvette will fit 
the rear of the '88 Fiero.</p>

<b><font face="Courier"><p>HUB, FRONT</b> </p>
<b><p>'88</b> The front hub in the '88 Fiero contains the front wheel bearing and is made as a sealed assembly which is not serviceable. This hub is no longer available from GM but new units can be obtained from fierostore.com or rodneydickman.com.</p>

<b><font face="Courier"><p>BRAKE HOSES</b> </p>
<p>As far as we can determine, no other cars used the same flexible brake hoses (the ones that 
attach to the calipers) as the Fiero.  This does not seem right to us.  We suspect that there 
are indeed other brake hoses that will fit but just have not found them.  In fact Aaron Trent 
found that the left rear brake hose on his '86 GT can be replaced by a left front brake hose 
from a '92 Honda Accord.  Arron had to re-use his old copper washer and banjo bolt, but it 
worked fine.  Thanks, Aaron, for this tip.  Note that the '86-88 Fieros used the same left rear 
brake hose, so the hose from the Honda Accord would fit these three years, not just the '86.</p>

<p>Some of the brake hoses in the Fiero were used more than one year.  Using the GM part numbers 
as a basis, the following Fiero years will swap:</p>

<b>'84 </b> Right front brake hose is unique<br>
<b>'84 </b> Left front brake hose is unique<br>
<b>'84-87 </b> Right rear brake hose is the same<br>
<b>'84-85 </b> Left rear brake hose is the same<br>

<b>'85-88 </b> Right front brake hose is the same<br>
<b>'85-87 </b> Left front brake hose is the same<br>
<b>'86-88 </b> Left rear brake hose is the same<br>
<b>'88 </b> Right rear brake hose is unique<br>
<b>'88 </b> Left front brake hose is unique<br>

<p>For the '88 Fiero (sorry we don't have info on other years), the following part numbers apply to 
the brake hoses:

<pre>
HOSE          AC DELCO #      GM #    WAGNER #  RAYBESTOS #  AUTO SPECIALTY #
Front, Left    18J668      18032379   F116843    BH38654        HB-80266
Front, Right   18J669      18032378   F116844    BH38653        HB-80267
Rear,  Left    18J652      18032363   F120873    BH38638        HB-82346
Rear,  Right   18J653      18032364   F120874    BH38639        HB-82347
</pre>

While the above numbers are for '88, note that the '85-88 right front is the same, and '86-88 left 
rear is the same.
