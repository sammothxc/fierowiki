<h1>Ogre's Rules and Terms of Use</h1>

<h2>Why all the new rules?</h2>

<p>Because some people can't understand life without them. So everyone gets stuck with them. There's nothing here that should be a problem for most people. It also lets everyone know just how little data I track in terms of site use. That sort of thing. <p>

<p>1. All documents are provided <span style="font-weight:bold;">AS IS</span>. While The Ogre makes every attempt to present documents that are accurate and complete, the documents may not contain all the information you need to perform the described work. <span style="font-weight:bold;">If you do not understand what you are doing, GET HELP!</span></p>
<p>2. These articles may require certain skills or tools. Performing work described in any article without such skills or tools is often dangerous. Sometimes even with the skills and tools the work is dangerous. <span style="font-weight:bold;">The Reader assumes ALL Risk and Liability in performing work described in these articles.</span> </p>
<p>3. The Ogre <span style="font-weight:bold;">does not</span> endorse any method of brake system modification. This topic is the result of my own investigation into proposed brake system "upgrades" and is provided ONLY to educate readers about the issues involved in brake system modifications. <span style="font-weight:bold;">The Reader assumes ALL Risk and Liability associated with such modifications. </span></p>
<p>4. Read ALL warnings and notes in the articles. Use all required safety devices and tools. <span style="font-weight:bold;">If you get hurt farting with some home made tool or drop a car on yourself or others, IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT!</span></p>
<p>5. Unless otherwise noted, ALL documents in the Ogre's Cave and Tunnel #6, The Ogre's Fiero Cave, are Copyrighted works. They may not be published in any media without written permission. (For reprint permission for articles in the Make Me section, contact the authors of the material in question. I cannot grant rights to that material ever.)</p>
<p>6. This site supports the concept of Fair Use under U.S. Copyright Law. You may print or archive copies of this site ONLY for your own NON commercial use.</p>
<p>7. The Ogre does not use cookies or otherwise collect any personally identifiable information. The logging I use presents only the total number of hits on a file or directory. This helps me decide if/when I will update or delete articles from the cave. Comcast can and probably does collect much more information than I do.</p>
