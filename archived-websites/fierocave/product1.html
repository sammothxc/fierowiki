<h2>Product Part Numbers and Reviews</h2>

<p>All product mentioned in Fiero Cave articles is reviewed and 
presented &quot;as vended.&quot; This means it is the product actually purchased from 
store shelves. No manufacturer or distributor has paid for placement in the 
cave.</p>
<h3>Why do you list so much MotorMite product?</h3>

<p>One very simple reason. They have essentially cornered the 
market on many parts that would other wise be unavailable to the public in many 
cases. They are often the only source for many of the fasteners and other items 
listed besides a dealer. The red carded HELP! product line alone caries more odd 
little bits of stuff than I can even begin to list. All MotorMite products 
listed by part number have been used or verified by me to work in the 
application indicated.</p>
<h3>Reviews</h3>

<p>Items reviewed in cave articles are all items I've purchased 
and used.</p>
