<h1>Engine &amp; Tranny Mounts</h1>
<h2>4 cylinder motor mount</h2>

<p>There are 2 kinds of motor mount available for Fiero 4 cylinder. (2 mounts from GM, 3 mounts
from aftermarket source.) You can get them solid or liquid filled. The
solid is less expensive but the liquid filled is better at isolating vibration.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Note: </span> Do not buy the Fluid Fill ("Hydraulic") one on any year Fiero. It doesn't last very long and last even  less 
in 86 and up w/ auto trans... The wet mount and Mono Mount Tranny goes dead in a 2-3 years.
<a href="atmstrut.htm">See this page.</a></p>

<p>Options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the solid rubber one for L4 w/ Manual Trans 
(Like Anchor part no. 2472) and <span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="mount-l4%5Barc%5D.htm">modify cradle bracket.</a></span> (Also very cheap option.)</li>
<li>AutoZone says it has Solid Rubber for Engine mount with Auto trans 
and no drilling. See DEA, Part Number: A2548. 
<span style="font-style:italic;">Note that 2548 is filled and <span style="font-weight:bold;">A</span>2548 is solid from DEA.</span></li> 
<li>Advance Auto Parts list Anchor Part No. 2548SR is solid rubber. 
<span style="font-style:italic;">Note that 2548 is filled and 2548<span style="font-weight:bold;">SR</span> is solid from Anchor.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold;">Thanks to deceler8...</span> Try Amazon for Anchor 2548SR. They are cheaper than auto parts store. (As of Feb-11)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some systems doesn't list solid rubber for L4 w/ manual trans? (Like Rock Auto and Advance) Try using V6, either trans, instead of L4. V6 also uses same mount.</p>
<h3>How do you detect a bad liquid filled mount?</h3>
<p><img src="mount/mount-bad.jpg" title="Bad Liquid Filled Mount" alt="Bad Liquid Filled Mount">
<img src="mount/mount-new.jpg" title="New Solid Rubber Mount" alt="New Solid Rubber Mount">
</p>

<p>First image above is a liquid filled mount and it's bad. If the motor
bracket is resting against the metal body or the safety pin then the mount is
bad and must be replaced. Other image is new solid rubber from Anchor and no holes drilled in either bracket.</p>

<p>Note! It is entirely possible to get a new liquid filled mount that is bad! When you buy a
liquid filled mount, you should not hear allot of sloshing when you shake it.
If it sloshes, it's bad. Don't accept it! (The mount will usually have a tiny
air bubble in it but it shouldn't slosh like a half empty soda bottle.) </p>

<p>A sloshing mount has air in it and won't be able to support the motor. Once
installed it should pass the above inspection, if not then take is back and get
another. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Or buy the solid rubber mount!</span> </p>

<h3>Changing the Mount</h3>

<p>You need a 15mm socket and a 15mm box end or flair fitting wrench. (I prefer
the flair wrench. It seems to grip better.)</p>

<p>Disconnect the battery.</p>

<p>Disconnect one end of the torque strut. (Dog Bone)</p>

<p>Jack the car, install a jack stand, and remove the right rear wheel. The top
nuts are easier to get if the wheel is off. (Yes, I've tried both ways... take
the wheel off.)</p>

<p>Remove all four nuts from the mount. These are lock nuts and will need to be
turned with a wrench all the way off. </p>

<p>Jack the motor up. Use a block of wood between the jack and oil pan. (If you
don't use the block the oil pan could collapse.) Keep the jack over toward the
transmission to it will lift straight. </p>

<p>Pull out the old mount and clean the motor bracket. Don't loose the top
washers that are likely buried in crud.</p>

<p>The new mount only fits one way.</p>

<p>Put the heat shield, the nuts and washers back on.</p>

<h2>Mount issues</h2>
<p>I haven't seen many problem on L4 engines with manual trans or all V6 with solid rubber but can happen.
Most engine or transmission mounts won't last long when soaked in oil. Polyurethane mounts can resist oil/chemicals but doesn't like them.</p>
<h3>Duke</h3>
<p>I'm not sure if Oil killed AT type liquid filled mounts for the Dukes but, again, Oil doesn't help them. 
The liquid filled ones leaked the fluid and "flat" rubber left had no strength.
Drill a small hole to let the oil and water out. Hole(s) are located at bottom corner in big hole in the rubber. 
(I made 2 Holes, 1 on each side.)  Anything gets in can quickly drain out and not eating rubber.</p>
<p><img src="mount/mount-drain.jpg" title="Mount with Drain" alt="Mount with Drain"></p>
<p>I think L4 engine brackets have three holes. My 87 L4 does, Two to attach the
mount, one for draining oil etc toward front of car.
Big problem is that hole drains oil on the cradle's
lower bracket. When that happens, Oil can/will drip for days. Rags etc to
keeping oil off of cradle is needed.</p>

<p><img src="mount/hole.jpg" title="Bracket Drain" alt="Bracket Drain">
</p>

<p>You need to keep the engine bracket clean so oil can get to the drain hole.
Many are full of crap after 25+ years of driving, changing oil, and so on.</p>

<p>When changing the oil, stuff a rag into the engine bracket to catch oil that
runs down while you change the filter. If you can keep oil off the mount then
it will last longer.</p>

<p><del>Consider making a shield for the mount out of some aluminum sheet 
and sandwich it between the top of the mount and bracket. This will help keep oil that 
runs down the bracket from pooling on top of the mount. Constant soaking in oil 
will shorten the life of the mount. It doesn't matter much how you make it as 
long as it deflects the oil that invariably spills from the filters during changing.</del><br>
You can try but could hide problem. OE heat sheild attaches to bottom bolts.</p>

<h3>Transmission and V6 Motor Mounts</h3>

<p>These are solid rubber mounts and there's not much to them. Most of the time you 
can easily see damage to a bad one. Sometimes the mounts tear away from the metal parts 
too cleanly to be obvious. If you think a mount may be bad and you can't see damage, 
try gently jacking up whatever the mount supports. Jacking will spread open any tears 
in the rubber. Don't get rough with the jack or you could tear a good mount. </p>

<p>When ever you have to replace a mount make sure you loosen all the others. That way 
the mounts can all settle into position without loading. </p>

<p>Except for 86.5 and later 4 cylinders with automatic transmission, you'll almost 
never see just one mount that is bad. The front mounts and the dog bone are the most 
likely to fail but it's entirely possible for all of them to be bad. (The 86.5 and 
later 4 cylinder/AT setup only has one engine mount and one transmission mount. 
Read the torque strut article for more info...) </p>

<p>Oil soaked mounts may not be torn but are probably considerably softer than they 
should be. Oil and other chemicals break down the rubber over time. 
Always clean off any oil that spills on them. </p>

<h3>Polyurethane mounts</h3>

<p>Polly mounts are generally perceived as better than OE style vulcanized rubber mounts. 
In some applications they probably are but for general use they simply aren't needed and 
are unlikely to do anything performance wise for the car.</p>

<p>Depending on just what ones you buy, many OE style mounts are stronger 
than the ones that came with the car.</p>

<p>Polly can also pass more vibration to the car, especially at idle in automatic transmission cars. 
(This has been proven with polly dog bones. The 4 cylinder motors are the worst for this.)</p>

<p>Polly mounts can add some color to the engine bay. They may tolerate the heat better. </p>

<p>They are more resistant to oil grease and other chemicals, which shouldn't be much of an 
issue. The mounts shouldn't be getting allot of stuff on them in normal use. The main source 
of oil on mounts is usually a sloppy oil change or a leaking gasket. Rubber mounts usually 
last years in even the worst environments. </p>
