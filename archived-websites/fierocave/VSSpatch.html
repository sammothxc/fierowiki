<h1>IGOR! Bring Another Brain! </h1>

<p class="warn">WARNING! This is an Expert
Level project and applies only to the 1227748 ECM. While the ECM is physically
simple to work on, debugging problems is not. Modification to ECM circuits must
be done very carefully. DO NOT experiment with the ECM and alternate PROM chips
without an ECM Scanner!</p>

<p class="warn">WARNING! The 1227748 ECM
contains integrated Cruise Control logic. Failure or improper calibration of
the Vehicle Speed Sensor circuit can cause potentially dangerous Cruise Control
problems. (Like Cruise Control isn't screwy enough to start with...)</p>
<p class="warn">WARNING: I strongly recommend you DO NOT try PROM chips from other motors.
You might only set weird codes in the ECM. You could cause the motor to
self-destruct.</p>

<p class="warn">NOTICE! The reader assumes
all risk and liability associated with the modifications described in this
document. If you goof around with the ECM and fry it or the PROM, too freaking
bad.</p>

<p>The PROM hacking info in this article is
for advanced users only. If your PROM has fried then order a new one using the numbers below.</p>

<h2><a name="prom"></a>DIS PROM update</h2>

<p>The following PROMs are listed as current numbers thru GM Parts Direct. They
can also be ordered thru places that carry AC Delco using the same part number.

<h2>ECM compatibility</h2>

<p>As I've mentioned in various threads,
Pontiac Grand AM and Olds Cutlass Calais with the DIS 4 cylinder use the same
ECM as 87-88 Fiero. Other potential sources and data on choosing are at the end
of the article.</p>

<p>While the ECM is the same, the PROM is
not. In Most cases, you will be installing the Fiero PROM into the replacement
ECM. You should always use Fiero PROM chips whenever possible. </p>

<h3>What happens if someone has fried the
Fiero PROM? Are their others that work?</h3>

<p>Try the updated PROM first! I can't
push this point enough. </p>

<p>Yes, it is possible to use PROM chips
from other cars. Before you can do so you have to know how this ECM works and
how to alter the VSS circuit.</p>

<p>The donor car must have:</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">The same motor. VIN R or U in Fiero case. (There
     are at least 3 motors using the 1227748 ECM.)</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">The same Transmission
     or as close as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll cover why this is important in
ECM Sources below...</p>

<h2>ECM configuration/hacking</h2>

<p>Unlike most other ECM units, the 1227748
ECM can be configured to accept a buffered VSS signal or the VSS can be wired
directly to it. The choice of which input the ECM will use is programmed into
the PROM. Normally only one input is actually wired. If the PROM selects the
wrong input, the ECM will set code 24 and Cruise Control will not operate. (An
ECM scanner will also report 0mph when the car is moving.)</p>

<p>In the FWD cars tested to date, the PROM
is programmed to select direct feed VSS instead of a buffered VSS like Fiero
uses. In order to use those PROM chips we have to patch the Fiero VSS directly
to the ECM.</p>

<h3>Hacking VSS</h3>

<p class="warn">Warning! Disconnect the
battery before making this modification!</p>

<p>To use PROMs set for direct input VSS in
Fiero, we need to patch the ECM Black connector Terminal 6 to connector C203
Terminal G. (Terminal markings are molded into the connector shells.)</p>

<p>C203 is the large connector sitting
below the ECM. Terminal G contains a Yellow wire between a Green and Pink/Black
wire.</p>

<p><img width="480" height="288" src="VSSpatch/image001.gif"></p>

<p>In Fiero Terminal position 6 on the Black
ECM connector is normally empty. Terminals for the ECM connectors are MotorMite
# 85323. Optionally you can salvage some terminals with wire from a donor car.
(Cut the wire as long as you can. You should be able to do this with only one
splice.)</p>

<p>To remove the pink cover from the ECM
connector, depress the two tabs showing through the main housing on the
&quot;small end&quot; of the shell. To release a terminal, insert a paper clip
into the hole on the ECM side of the shell and then pull the terminal out the
back.</p>

<p>Note. Do Not alter the OE wiring in any
other way. You want the car to continue to accept a Fiero PROM. Once this patch
is made, the car will accept either the FWD PROM or the Fiero PROM and still
see the VSS. </p>

<p>You can splice the yellow wire described
above with any method you like. Just make sure it can't come loose or short.
The blue 3M &quot;ScotchLock&quot; speed taps are good for this. Just squash
the thing onto the wires, close the lid and you're done with it.</p>

<h4>Does the patch cause any problems?</h4>

<p>The patch will not cause trouble as long as it is done right. The VSS has
enough drive voltage/current to handle both the speedometer and the ECM feed.
The ECM simply ignores the unused input when both circuits are wired.</p>

<h4>Why would we want to use alternate PROM chips?</h4>

<p>The big reason is that these ECM units are allot easier to find in the FWD
cars. If something happened to fry the Fiero PROM, we need an alternate that
will work. Many of these alternate PROM chips will allow the car to run
properly as long as we lie to them about the VSS.</p>

<p>Another reason is that the &quot;corrective&quot; PROM chips listed in a GM
TSB are $60 each from the dealer. (They are allot cheaper thru GM Parts
Direct!) With the above patch, we can play with various PROMs from later models
of cars with this motor. This is the reason I worked out the above patch. (I
did this patch before finding the PROMs for cheap.)</p>

<p>Some of it is just to see what the different programming will do. I did it
just to see things like: Does it solve the problems in the TSB? Will I gain any
power? Will it idle any better? Will it get even more MPG?</p>

<h4>Test Results?</h4>

<p>I've tested PROM chips from the 88 Grand Am (VIN U) and the 87 Cutlass Calais
(VIN U). (I have 87SC, Automatic transmission... VIN R) I've had no major
problem with either. The one from the Calais ran ok but idled like crap with
the AC on. <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">The Grand Am one is in it now.</span> It seems to run a little better then
the OE one. (Now I've got new Fiero Update PROM.)</p>

<p>I simply can't test every PROM available for this ECM. That means certain
Grand Am or Calais PROM chips may cause trouble. You probably won't do any
damage but you could get Error 24 and Cruise Control may not work right. If you
have problems, the only way to figure it out is with an ECM scanner. </p>

<p>I have no plans to test chips from 2.0l or 2.2l engines. If you try a PROM
from one of the other motors, be extremely careful. These chips can potentially
fry the motor. You must have an ECM scanner and other tools to make sure the
PROM is running right. </p>

<h2>Where to find ECM's</h2>

<p>The ECM is located under the passenger
side of the dash on both Grand Am and Olds Cutlass Calais. I think in Grand Am
they used the DIS motor from 87-89. In Olds I think they used them from 87-91.
Try to find ECM units with the label on them. Don't use one until you are sure
it's correct. (The ones I've actually used are 88 Grand Am and 87 <span style="layout-grid-mode:line">Calais<span style="layout-grid-mode:
line">. I've seen the DIS motor in 91 <span style="layout-grid-mode:
  line">Calais but haven't been able
to check that ECM.)</p>

<p>If you are harvesting the ECM, cut out
the connectors with as much wire as you can get. This will give you a bunch of
wired spare terminals.</p>

<p>The GM service replacement ECM's that I've seen are also labeled with the
1227748 part number.</p>

<p>Aftermarket replacements may have the part GM number on them of not. There is
no standard with them.</p>

<h3>Other ECM Sources</h3>

<p>ACdelco list of models uses <a href="https://fierowiki.samwarr.dev/api/public/dl/EvpPN0OJ/docs/fierocave-docs/1227748.pdf">1227748 ECM.</a></p>

<p>DIY-EFI.org reports this ECM is used with the following motors. I have not
verified the data.</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
<li>1987-91 2.0 OHC L4 TBI &quot;K&quot; LT2</li>

<li>1990-91 2.2 L4 TBI &quot;G&quot; LM3</li>

<li>1987-92 2.5 L4 TBI &quot;R&quot; LR8 [Fiero] (exc. W body)</li>

<li>1987-91 2.5 L4 TBI &quot;U&quot; L68 </li>
</ul>

<p>I have seen a version of the DIS motor used in the S10 truck. That ECM can't
be used in Fiero. The motor is similar but uses an EGR solenoid like the Fiero
V6 motors. The ECM and wiring are completely different.</p>

<p>Note! Make sure the PROM is correct for
the transmission. If possible, you want them to match Stick/Auto, number of
gears, and final drive ratio. At the very least, they must match Stick or Auto.</p>

<p>If you put a stick chip in an automatic
car, you'll have TC lock problems and probably other odd things. I'm not sure
what an auto chip would do in a stick car other than make the shift light
activate over 35mph.</p>

<p>Chip selection for an automatic is
easier. The TH125 automatics are mostly the same except for some variation in
final drive. For the two chips I've tested, I didn't look at the transmission
beyond it being a TH125 automatic. Either they were close enough or the chip
didn't care.</p>

<p>In a stick car, they have to match gear
count and finals better than an automatic. If they don't match you'll have the
shift light going nuts. (Allot of people hate that thing and pull the bulb even
when it works right.) You might get some ECM codes depending on how different
the transmission is from what the chip thinks is there.</p>
