<h1>Gen 2 HL actuator system</h1>

<p class="warn">Warning! The headlights and actuator system have power at all
times. Power is delivered thru 3 fuse links and one fuse. Never assume the
system is dead unless the battery is disconnected! Always unplug the motor
before working on the lift assembly!</p>

<p class="note">Note: Module has two methods to shut off the motor... Load "switch" is the normal way it works. 
If motor had dead gears or bushings then the module has a Timer to kill the motor in 5-6 seconds so a bad motor will not kill your battery. 
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p><img src="hlmotor/image001.jpg" title="Module" alt="Module"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(Image source: Rodrv6. Module pictured as installed in 88
Fiero, 87 Fiero is the same.)</p>

<p>The second-generation actuator system is far more reliable than the original
system used thru the 1986 model year. </p>

<ul style="margin-top:0pt" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Motor
     control is consolidated into a single module hidden under the left fender.
     (Shown above.)</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">The
     module is current sensing, which eliminates torque switches in the motor.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Only
     two wires run to each motor.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">The
     motors are designed for more strength and easier repairs.</li>
</ul>

<p>The current sensing ability of the module means the motors will stop
immediately if they are overloaded. This protects the entire system from
breakage due to jamming or ice. Current sense can shut the motors down far
faster than the mechanical system used in first generation motors.</p>

<p>One fuse link is used to supply each motor with power. If one link fries the
other motor will still run. (The electronics in the module can take power from
both power feeds. Diodes prevent power from flowing into the dead circuit.)</p>

<h2>Wiring</h2>

<p class="note">Note: There is a Typo in some diagrams, including 88 SM. <a href="hlmotor88sm.htm">See here.</a></p>

<p><img src="hlmotor/image003.gif" title="System Wiring" alt="System Wiring"> </p>

<p>The wires to the control side of the module are shown out of order above...
It was easier to draw this way. If you go by the photo above, A is the bottom
terminal on the left connector.</p>

<p>The grounds are the same ones used for all the lamps in front. There's one
on either side of the radiator someplace. Just follow the harness. Power and
control lines are routed thru C100, which is the big bulkhead connector near
the gas pedal.</p>

<p>The motors connect directly to the module. There are 2 wires for each motor.
Left, striped Light Green/Black and Gray/Black. Right, solid color Dark Green
and Gray.</p>

<p>The two fuse links for the actuators are normally looped over a plastic ring
around the harness conduit. This is done so you can find them if they fail.
They will also do less damage to other wiring when they burn. Some people think
this is a wiring mistake and shove them into the conduit. (Don't do that! If
you did, pull them back out.) The links are located about 4-6 inches before
where the harness passes thru the tire support wall. It is pretty unusual for
the fuse links to fail. </p>

<h2>Trouble Shooting</h2>

<p>The second-generation system is extremely reliable but like any aging car
system, things do go wrong.</p>

<h3>Does the motor run when the HL switch is turned on or off?</h3>

<p>If the motor turns but doesn't lift, you likely need Rodney Dickman's repair
kit. Order kits for both motors. If one is broken the other likely isn't far
behind. This is probably the most common problem with this system. (Another
symptom of bad dowels, the light may lift if the hood is open but not when it's
shut...)</p>

<h3>Motor(s) intermittently won't open and/or close.</h3>

<p>Make sure the motor and lift isn't binding. If the motor or lift is binding
then the controller will shut off power to protect the motor.</p>

<p>Try manually spinning the motor 1 turn to unload the stop and then cycle the
HL switch. (Be careful you don't get pinched!)</p>

<p>You may need to lubricate the motor gears. (Even if you just rebuilt
them...) </p>

<p>Check the grounds on the front electrical harness. </p>

<h3>1 motor doesn't run at all</h3>

<p>Try the above test first.</p>

<p>Unplug the motor. Manually rotate the emergency knob until the light is 1/2
way up or down then apply 12V and ground directly to the connector on the
motor. If the motor moves the problem is the module or a fuse link.</p>

<h3>Both motors don't run down</h3>

<p>Check the taillight fuse and headlight switch. If they look good or you
can't tell, apply 12V to the white wire on the HL switch connector. If the
motors still won't go down then the white wire is damaged or the module is bad.</p>

<h3>Both motors don't run up</h3>

<p>If the lamps turn on then the HL switch is ok. The yellow wire may be
damaged or the module may be bad.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<p class="warn">For more Troubleshooting, <a href="hlmotor88sm.htm">see here.</a></p>


<p>If both motors are acting flakey or fail to run, check the ground before
replacing the module. Especially when you know both motors are ok. Follow the
front wiring harness to find where the ground attaches to the frame. (The
module uses the same ground points at the headlights and park/turn lights.) The
module may react to a bad ground before you can easily see it as dim headlights,
turn signal problems, etc.</p>

<h2>Parts and service</h2>

<p class="warn">WARNING: DO NOT force the lift shaft thru the bearing! Clean off
any dirt and file off any mushroom at the end of the shaft. If you force the
bearing over the garbage you will damage it and the seal.</p>

<p>If you are careful, you can often open the gear case without damaging the
gasket. If one spot sticks, carefully work it with an Exacto knife or razor
blade. That will often get it loose with minimal or no damage.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181132/http://www.rodneydickman.com/" target="_&quot;blank&quot;">Rodney</a> has kits to replace the
dowels that live between the big gear and the shaft. 2 kits, enough to do both
motors, and shipping costs around $10. The kits come with instructions that
cover reconditioning the entire motor. He also has cover and motor gaskets if
you need them.</p>

<p>Lubrication: Grease the gear teeth with &quot;white lithium.&quot; Use light
oil in the shaft bearings. Don't get sloppy with the oil. You don't want oil
getting on the motor brushes! Oil/grease on the brushes will burn and kill the
motor. I used Valvoline SynPower synthetic spray oil on the bearings. Don't use
WD-40 or Liquid Wrench. &quot;3 in 1&quot; or gun oil should also work.</p>

<p>The &quot;easy&quot; way to access the module is to unfasten the front part
of the inner fender where it connects to the fender. The inner fender is
flexible enough to bend considerably without damage. 2 screws hold the module
in place.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the motors and module can be found in other GM cars like
Sunbirds with the little half door and late model Firebird or Trans Am. As
expensive as the motors and module are new, it's worth checking the yards. Take
the bad one with you for comparison.</p>

<p>The module in the Sunbird is on the left strut tower. I don't know where it
is in the others.</p>

<p>The motors may be reversed in some cars. You may want the right motor from
another car to replace the left one in Fiero and vise versa.</p>

other modules could work if you rewire and add a relay for some modules.
 May be a option if 16523917 is not avaible.</p>

<h2>Dead Fuse(s) or Fried parts in the Module</h2>

<p>The Module has two &quot;fuse&quot; on Module's PCB, label F1 and F2, to protect
the board.</p>
<p><img src="hlmotor/g2fuses.jpg" title="Module with a blown fuse" alt="Module with a blown fuse"> </p>

<p>If you take apart the Module and find one or both are blown then carefully
check the motors, wiring to them and front ground wiring or new module can fry
fuses or worse too. If you don't find the
real problem then the new module can have a very short life.</p>

<p>Fried MOSFET and other parts could be problems in the module and/or the
motors or wiring to them.</p>

<p>A &quot;Hard&quot; short, like a body hole cut into a wire shorting out the
circuit, can blow a fuse. An intermittent issue or a motor that use more power can
be harder to find the problem. Read <a href="emotor.htm">Electric Motors</a> too because bad power
and/or grounds can make the motors to draw more amps.</p>

<h3>Can the module be repaired?</h3>
<h4>Can you fix the Fuse?</h4>
<p>IF you find the problem, like a shorted wire to the motor, that causes the
fuse to blow then maybe. Problem is GM never published the data needed to fix
these. I have no idea what exact wire type used, etc, so don't ask me.</p>

<h4>Only Relay is bad?</h4>
<p>If the Relay's contacts are worn out or the coil dies then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181132/http://www.fiero.nl/forum/Archives/Archive-000001/HTML/20120111-2-110277.html" target="_blank">Try this in Forum...</a><br>
If the Relay is fried then the Module is likely junk.</p>
<h4>Other died/fried parts?</h4>
<p class="warn">Warning: Most people should not fix dead MOSFET. The burnt MOSFET maybe a symptom and not a root cause. 
Fixing the obvious can bite you and cause more money, much more... </p>

<p>The MOSFET and maybe fuse ("fuse" on Module's PCB, label F1 and F2.) will blow if module can't read motor load. Any component 
bad or even a solder crack can keep Module from reading motor load. Module then "falls back" on Timer to shut off power to motor. 
Big problem... The Motor in Stalled condition at end of travel, means motor will spike amps to max circuit allows, 20 amps or more, 
will fry the MOSFET, maybe the "fuse" and/or relay, and even toast one or both motors. </p>

<h2><a name="upgrade"></a>Gen 2 Motor Conversion</h2>

<p>As you've probably heard, you can convert from Gen 1, with its weak motors
and relays, to the much tougher Gen 2 system. I don't have all the details on
this. If you have problems doing it, post in the forums.</p>

<p>The Ideal way to do this is convert the whole front wiring harness to the
87-88 harnesses but this isn't possible or practical for many people. The
supply of good used Fiero harness is rather low but fortunately there are other
ways to get the desired result. Just go to your local salvage yards and surf
for Sunbird and Trans Am from the late 80's and early 90's. (You're looking for
Sunbirds with the little half door.) </p>

<p>David Bartlett of the forums recently did this using the wiring, motors and module from a Sunbird.
He indicated everything was pretty much plug and play with one exception. He
said you've got to swap the up/down control wires. So White from the Fiero HL
switch goes to the Yellow on the Sunbird harness, etc.</p>

<p>To extract the harness from the Sunbird, start at the motors, and follow the
wires back to the module. This part will likely go faster if you have some
small scissors to cut any tape you run into. Once you get to the module, cut
the wires going to the big connector leaving plenty of wire on it.</p>

<p>Read Wire Service for several ideas on waterproof splicing methods. If you
stagger the distance of the splices from the module, you should be able to hide
them more easily in the OE harness coverings. The Module can be mounted
anywhere the wiring will reach.</p>

<p>While pulling the complete motor wiring from the Sunbird or whatever is more
time consuming, you will get a cleaner installation when everything goes into
the Fiero. The Michigan method likely works but requires more wire splices. My
feeling is that you will always be better off avoiding as many splices as
possible.</p>

<p>Yes, it is possible to do this with no splices at all but that is beyond many
people. If you really want to do that, I think you can get the crimp tool and
terminals thru Pep Boys and other places that carry MotorMite. I recommend you
solder the terminals as well because it's hard to get them right with a hand
crimper. You don't want them pulling apart.</p>

<h3>Would Ogre do this conversion?</h3>

<p>Absolutely! There is no way in hell I'd spend the money to fix the old
motors. If it was just a relay, maybe but anything else isn't worth the trouble
unless you are showing in a strict factory class. Anyone with bad Gen 1 motors
is much better off converting to Gen 2. </p>
