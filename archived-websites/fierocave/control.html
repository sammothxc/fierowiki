<h1>Controlling Control Arms</h1>

<p>The control arm bushings are a pain in the ass but they aren't as difficult
aren't as people make them out.</p>

<p>For 84-87 control arms using OE or aftermarket Polyurethane: (I'm not
getting into specialty bushings like those from 8Shark and others. Contact
those guys for info on their products.)</p>

<ul type="disc">
 <li>The rear and lower front arms
     are non adjustable. </li>
 <li>For caster, the front upper
     arm is adjusted by changing the washers between the bushings and the
     mounting bracket. The camber is adjusted at the ball joint. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Ball joints</h2>
<p class="warn">Warning: You should replace the lower front Ball Joint. Even if
they look good or some test passed, 20+ years of the spring trying constantly to split the joint
and wear from hit/bump it only a matter of time before it dies. And unlike top
front and rear joints, there's often no warning it's going to fail.</p>

<p>If Lower Joint fails, potentially can cause major wreck because no steering
of dead wheel and can lock the wheel from turning at all.</p>
<h4>How Bad?</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">Like this:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><img width="324" height="243" src="control/bad-lbj-stud2a.jpg" title="LBJ with Missing Stud" alt="LBJ with Missing Stud"></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Source: dejulio in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181138/http://www.fiero.nl/forum/Forum2/HTML/108912.html" target="_blank">forum
post.</a></p>

<p>Note that a broken stud is damage from over torquing the nut too. When you work on or replace a BJ, watch your torque. Can take days to years to show damage.</p>
<p>The front UCA ball joints are the only adjustable ones. All others are
pressed into the arm.</p>

<p>The factory UCA ball joint allows about 1&deg; of change. To alter
the setting you take out the bolts and rotate the shell 180&deg;. It's
not much adjustment but it may be enough to get into spec.</p>

<p>Moog Problem Solver ball joints are slotted for camber adjustment. Loosen
the bolts, set camber, and tighten the bolts. (Other brands of replacement
joints may also allow this. Some simply duplicate the OE joint.)</p>

<p>The pressed in ball joints may also be tack welded. The weld must be
carefully ground away before pressing out the joint.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p>You can often borrow, with a deposit, tools for pressing both ball joints
and bushings. Autozone and Pep Boys offer this service. I'm not going to explain
how to use the press. If you can't figure it out then you probably shouldn't be 
messing with this job.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bushing Press. See <a href="bushings.htm#tool">Bushings</a></li>

<li>Ball joint separator. You can make one easy enough.  
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181138/http://www.rodneydickman.com/" target="_blank">Rodney</a> sells one that doesn't cost much.</li>

<li>A tie rod end seperator. Avoid the "Pickle fork" kind if you are saving rod ends.  A small Pickle fork can help you work the long bolt out of the upper control arm. 
Use it to load the end washer while you turn the bolt back and forth.</li>
<li>If needed, Dremel tool or some other small grinder to remove the
tack welds. (Some are welded.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Before taking the UCA off, measure it's position.</h2>

<p>People keep asking how to get the front upper arm back into its original
position. This question usually comes up after the arm has been removed... Too
bad, if people had taken some simple measurements before they started things
would be much easier. It also helps if you keep those washers in their original
order but don't count on them going back in the same way they came out.</p>

<p>Because of the way 84-87 Fiero is built the only measurements needed are the
for/aft position of the arm on the pivot bolt and the ball joint location. </p>

<p>Scribe reference marks on the arm and hardware as needed. You want clear
marks that won't be mistaken for tool marks or something later. I use X or &gt;
marks. There is a trick to insure good clear arrow marks. Start the lines at
the point and pull away. Don't worry about making them pretty. Just make sure
they have good clear points. Make as many reference marks as you need on the
arm and the surrounding hardware.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter much how you choose to take your measurements as long as
they are accurate and repeatable. Use a good ruler. A set of dividers comes in
handy to. Make a note of the position of the control arm when you made the
measurement. You'll need the control arm close to that position again later.
Carefully measure the distance between your marks <i>and write them down.</i></p>

<p>If you are installing or replacing slotted upper ball joints... To get a
rough measurement on the ball joint, measure from the scribe marks on the UCA
to the hole the grease fitting goes into.</p>

<p>If you are replacing an OE style joint with another OE style one, simply
trace the outline of the joint to the UCA. That will help you remember what
direction the joint was offset.</p>

<p><img width="338" height="236" src="control/image002.gif" title="Upper Control Arm with scribe marks added" alt="Upper Control Arm with scribe marks added"></p>

<p>Now take apart the arm. Keep the washers in their original order. They will
be your starting place later. The two inner washers are the most important.
I'll explain them more in a minute.</p>

<p>Install the new bushings.</p>

<p>Now fit the arm with the washers in their original order. Tighten the nut
all the way home. (Hold the arm in the same position it was when you made your
earlier measurements.)</p>

<p>Measure the distance between marks just like you did earlier.</p>

<p>If needed, switch the inner washers to duplicate the original measurements.</p>

<p>The washers set the caster. As long as you can get the arm back into it's
original for aft position, the caster should be within spec even if it's not
identical to original.</p>

<p>It's common for the washers to be different thickness. If you can't get the
arms into position with the washers you have, you'll need to find others. If
you can't get the washers new, then scrounge the salvage yards for some more of
them.</p>

<h2>The Caster Washers</h2>
<p class="note">Note: The kit noted below was discontinued long ago. Moog's kit has been discontinued as well. 
The Fiero Store has a kit, current as of 3/1/2011, part number 57016.
</p>


<p>The 2 washers between the UCA and mounting bracket set the caster.
According to GM, the sum of all washers used here must equal 12mm of total
thickness. (If not, you bind the bushings and pinch the UCA. Not good.)</p>

<p>If you forgot which two were originally in the middle, pick two that total
12mm thick.</p>

<p>GM documents I've seen indicate that there was a kit that had a 3mm and
9mm washer in it. This kit gives a plus/minus 1&deg; adjustment vs.
using two 6mm washers. </p>

<p><img width="338" height="236" src="control/image004.gif" title="Upper Control Arm Schematic" alt="Upper Control Arm Schematic"></p>

<p>When reinstalling the arm you could run into one of two problems:</p>

<ol start="1" type="1">
 <li>You have two 6mm washers and can't
     get the kit to make an adjustment.</li>
 <li>You have the kit installed
     already but need to center the arm on the bracket.</li>
</ol>

<p>A way around this could be to check the thickness of the outer end washers.
These outer washers should be fairly common in the salvage yards. You may be
able to buy matching spares in a parts store.</p>

<p>If the outer washers are 3mm thick, you could use 4 of them in the inner
area to allow adjustment similar to the kit. To make the adjustment you'd do
one of the following. (Adjustment is relative to centering the UCA on the
bracket.)</p>

<ol start="1" type="a">
 <li>Put one washer in front and
     three in the back for a +1 degree adjustment from centered.</li>
 <li>Put two washers on each side
     to center the UCA on the bracket.</li>
 <li>Put three washers in front
     and one in the back for a -1 degree adjustment from centered.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's conceivably possible that you could also use end washers and STEEL flat
washers. (Grade 8 [class 10.9] washers recomended.) The most critical thing is that the combined thickness of all the
washers between the UCA and bracket equals 12mm. </p>

<h2>Polyurethane in Control Arms</h2>

<p>I'm not a big fan of using polyurethane in control arms. Flat out I think
its way more trouble than it's worth for cars that are mainly driven on the
street. Since people are going to install them anyway, here's some stuff that should
help.</p>

<p>As I explained in the bushing article, Polyurethane bushings in the control
arms will mainly serve as a bearing. It will absorb some impact thru compression.</p>

<p>They pivot against the inner sleeve and the ends. Clean everything that will
touch the ends or inside of the bushings before installing them. Make sure the
surfaces are smooth. This includes the washers or frame areas that will contact
the ends of the bushings. Dirt and rough surfaces can make even well greased
bushings squeak and groan. </p>

<p>Don't worry much about the bushing shell. Just make sure there are no lumps
of rubber left. The bushing doesn't rotate against the shell. If it does,
something is wrong. The bushing should fit very snug into the outer shell. They
will often need to be squeezed in with a large C clamp. You do not need, or
even want, to grease the outside of the bushing or the shell. You want the
shell to grip that surface the best it can.</p>

<h3>Maintenance</h3>
<p class="note">Never use oil based product. Only Silicone or Silicone with Teflon.
<p>You will need to lube them. Problems are:
<ul>
<li>Too many makers and worse, they can products formulas etc. so very little to know when and how often.
<li>Too many way to install them.
<li>Noise in obvious but Polly can wear without noise.
</ul>

<p>Many use Grease fittings to make that easier. They drill a hole thru outer sleeve and busning.</p>
