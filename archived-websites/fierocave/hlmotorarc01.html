I had rebuilt/restored both my headlight motors on my 85GT and thought I
 was good for a couple years. Meanwhile I had picked up 88 Firebird 
headlight parts for the day I wanted to do a conversion. Well as things 
would go, the right side quit this week. The down limit switch decided 
it would break, so no better time to convert then now. <br><br>I didn't 
have a Fiero wire harness and really didn't care if I had one since I 
planned on just "doing it" so thought I might as well write it up if 
someone else wanted to do one. <br><br>So lets get started. Didn't take a
 lot of pictures so will try to explain while I go. I took my time and 
was able to do this in three hours with breaks. If you don't get done 
you can always install the buckets and manually run the lights in a 
pinch. <br><br><a class="HTMLBodyLink" href="hlmotorarc01/Headlightmotor.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a>   is what your starting with.<br>This is what we are shooting for when done. <br>      <br><img style="width: 640px; height: 561px;" src="hlmotorarc01/HeadlightConv.jpg"><br><br>****************Now
 the disclaimer:  Once you start this there is no return unless you want
 to re-splice your cuts. I have documented this and believe it to be 
accurate. Proceed at your own risk. **********  <br><br>I decided I was 
not going to put the module in the standard Fiero location but would 
keep in it the trunk. Nice spot seemed to be right in front of the brake
 master. <br><br>Here are the parts I started with. A left and right 
motor with plugs and fair amount of wire on each, and the module with 
plugs and some wire. I picked the parts up at a U-pull-it for $25.  I 
bench tested all three parts before installing them. <br><br><img style="width: 521px; height: 554px;" src="hlmotorarc01/Parts.jpg"><br><br>The module has a 5 pin plug (control and power) and a 4 pin plug (Motor connections). Both plugs are labled A-E and A-D.<br><br>If you look at the 5 wire plug closest to you there are the following wires. <br>A- Yellow - Open power signal. <br>B- Red - Fuseable link power for motors. <br>C- White - Close power signal. <br>D- Black - Ground. <br>E- Red - Fuseable link power for motors.<br><br>As it just happend GM kept these five wire colors the same between the Firebird and the Fiero making these five fairly easy. <br><img src="hlmotorarc01/FirebirdheadlightModule.jpg"><br><br>After pulling the headlight buckets this is what your left with. <br><br><img src="hlmotorarc01/Wirepathandsockets.jpg"><br><br>Next I pulled the wires out of the loom so I could locate the wires needed. Here are the points I exposed the wires. <br>You will find the two fuseable links near the brake master. <br><br><img src="hlmotorarc01/Prep1.jpg"><br><br>And another angle. <br><br><img src="hlmotorarc01/Prep2.jpg"><br><br>1. The first step is to disconnect the battery since you will be working with some wires with power on them. <br>2.
 Locate the LH headlight relay socket plug with the red, two pink and 
black wires. Cut all four of these off the plug. You will endup using 
three. The red will be pulled back to the module, the two pink will be 
spiced together to get motor power the right hand motor.   <br><img src="hlmotorarc01/headRelaySocket.jpg"><br>3.
 Where the small loom goes up and over the radiator locate the one red 
(power) to the right hand motor and cut it at this location. <br>This will also be pulled back to where you mount your module.<br><img src="hlmotorarc01/Cut1.jpg"><br>4.
 Pull the black wire (ground from the headlight relay) and both red 
wires out of the loom back to the place where the wires come from the 
trunk to the headlight area.  (the area where the ISO relay wires are 
located. <br>5. The two pink wires you cut from the headlight relay will
 be used to run motor power to the RH motor. I spliced these two 
together so that I could pull the longer pink wire going to the RH motor
 side back to the Iso relay area using the pink wire that had connected 
to the Iso relay. The splice pulled back to this area and then I removed
 the short pink piece used to pull it. It is no longer needed.  <br>6. Cut the plugs off that connected to the Iso relay.<br>7. Time to stop and check your wires. In the Iso Relay area you should have the following wires. <br>     (2) Red wires. Fuseable link power.  <br>     (1) Dk Blue/wht  RH motor power<br>     (1 ) Pink      RH motor power<br>     (1) Yellow    <br>     (1) White   <br>
     (1) Black - It's your choice here. This can be used as the ground 
for the module or you can just use a ground in the trunk area of your 
choice. I use one of the headlight ground wires. <br>8. Now your going 
to pulled the following wires into the trunk area or where ever you are 
going to locate your module. But read on before you pull them since you 
are going to use some of these wires to also pull others wires needed 
into the trunk.  <br>    (2) Red wires.<br>     (1) Yellow<br>     (1) White<br>     (1) Black <br>
     The above listed wires when pulled into the truck area will also be
 used to pull four additional wires from the headlight area back to 
where the module will be. The four will use to get power to the new 
motors.  <br>9. Where the wires go through the gromet into the trunk 
they are wrapped in tape. The gromet is full but you can pull the wires 
through since it stretches and you are removing a couple wires while 
adding others. I had no problem doing this.<br>10. To keep the motor 
wire colors matching on the module plug I use the wire from the new 
motor plugs since they also match and I had pulled enough out of the 
donor car. One motor plug has a green and gray wire pair, the other has a
 Green/blk and Gray/blk pair. <br>11. I picked one or the new plugs that
 had wires long enough to reach from the module to the LH motor 
location. I temporarily spliced and taped these onto the Red wires to be
 used to pulled them into the trunk area. Then remove the splices.  <br>12.
 I now cut some wire off the other new motor plug leaving about 8 inches
 on the plug to be spliced onto the wires for the RH motor. Using the 
wire you just cut off permanently spliced them to the Dk Blue/Wht wire 
and Pink wire you pulled back in the Iso Relay area. Note which color 
you connect to which wire as you will need to know this later.  I then 
temporarily spliced these two wires and the black ground wire to the 
Yellow and White wires using them to pull the two motor wires and a 
ground wire into the trunk area.<br><br>It starts to look like this. Looks like a mess but will work out.  <br><img src="hlmotorarc01/Pulled.jpg"> <br><br>13. Now in the trunk area you should have the follow group of wires. <br>     (2) Red wires.<br>     (1) Yellow<br>     (1) White<br>     (1) Black  <br>     Pair (1) Green and (1) Gray<br>     Pair (1) Green/blk  (1) Gray/blk<br>14.
 If you have used the above parts from a firebird all that should be 
left is to splice these wires to the corresponding module wires. I used 
the standard twist the wires and solder after slipping a piece of heat 
shrink tubing over each of the wires. After your done, dress the looms 
back up nice and neat. <br><br>15. All that is left to do is cut the 
plug off the RH motor relay and the single plug on the Drk blue/wht. You
 then can splice the remaining motor plug onto the pink wire and the Dk 
blue/wht wire matching them the same as noted in step 12. You did note 
that didn't you....?<br><br>That should do it... Install the the new 
motors in the headlight buckets and install them.  Don't forget to 
shorten the one bolt on each motor so the arm does on hit it when it 
rotates. <br>  <br><br><img src="hlmotorarc01/FinishedWiring.jpg"><br><br><br>

Dodgerunner-<br>Good thread.   <img src="hlmotorarc01/smile.gif"><br><br>What model year range of Firebird headlight motors and control will work?<br><br>A quote: "1. The first step is to disconnect the battery since you will be working with some wires with power on them. <br>2.

Not sure on all the years that use the 2gen system but believe it's like 88-92 or so.. <br>I'll have to look that up and see. <br><br>On the pink wires, guess that is worded somewhat incorrect, but to answer your quesiton. <br><br>If
 you look at the pink wires on the orig. schematic it runs from the ISO 
relay to the LH Headlight relay and then jumps over to the RH relay. You
 are only going to use one of the pink wires to run power over to the RH
 motor. The one that runs from the ISO relay to the first (LH) relay is 
fairly short. When I cut them off the LH relay socket I spliced the two 
pinks together and used the one going to the ISO relay area to pull the 
longer one from the RH relay through the harness back to the ISO area. 
Then cut the short one off and tossed it.  So you only end up using the 
one pink wire... the other was just to pull the other back. <br><br>That is what I explained in #5.<br><br>But thanks, I edited it a bit..</font><p><font class="HTMLBodyText"><font class="EditedBy">[This message has been edited by Dodgerunner (edited 06-22-2008).]</font></font></p><p align="right"><font class="HTMLIPText">IP: Logged</font></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table>
