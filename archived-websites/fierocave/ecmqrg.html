<h1>Making Sense</h1>
<h2>Sensors Quick Referent</h2>
<p>The table below list the sensors by name, the engine types it is found on,
the class of sensor it is, mounting characteristics, and very briefly what it
does. It is intended as a quick reference only. For more detailed information
read the related article(s). &nbsp; </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">WARNING! Over torque of NPT threaded sensors can cause major engine
damage. </span>NPT, <span style="font-weight:bold;">N</span>ational <span style="font-weight:bold;">P</span>ipe <span style="font-weight:bold;">T</span>hread, is a tapered threading used
for plumbing. Sensors with this thread can crack block and manifold mounting ports
if over tightened. Do not treat this like a regular bolt. NPT sensors will
normally &quot;go tight&quot; about 66% of the threaded area.</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>

<ol start="1" type="1">
 <li>
     These are electrically pretty
     much the same. The difference is mostly in the method of mounting.</li>
 <li>
     Don't use Teflon thread
     sealing tape on grounded shell NPT sensors. It will likely interfere with
     getting a good electrical connection through the threads.</li>
 <li>
     ECM coolant, MAT, and ACT,
     use the same value NTC thermistor internally. The test table below 
applies to all of them. (An NTC Thermistor is a temperature
     sensitive resistor that drops resistance as temperature rises.)</li>
 <li>
     MAT and ACT are essentially
     the same sensor with different names based on location of the sensor. ACT
     sensors often tend to use epoxy-coated thermistors while MAT is not
     coated. Sensors without the coating are a little faster responding than
     coated ones. This is rather important for MAT where it can see 20+F
     temperature changes in a couple seconds. An ACT sensor, because of its
     location in the air cleaner of the V6 can be a little slower and still
     function correctly. Uncoated sensors will always have a plastic guard
     cage.</li>
 <li>
     On HEI systems, the PIM/ICM 
     is normally screwed to the distributor and uses mounting screws as part of its ground path. The PIM on DIS motors is
     sandwiched in between the coils and the aluminum mounting plate. The crank
     position sensor is under the DIS mounting plate. </li>
 <li>
     Always check engine grounds
     whenever there is a problem with the O2 sensor. This sensor generates only
     1VDC max. Grounding problems can cause the ECM to read the wrong voltage.</li>
 <li>
     The TPS is a mechanical
     sensor and is subject to wear contamination and breakage. The TPS is the
     only sensor in Fiero with moving parts.</li>
 <li>
     This sensor measures pressure
     with a solid-state transducer. The top or bottom of this sensor may have
     vent holes. Do not allow solvents to enter the vent holes as you could
     ruin the transducer.</li>
 <li>
     Lobes, vanes, flaps, whatever
     favorite name for them is...</li>
 <li>
     No. You can't convert a
     distributor motor to DIS or the other way around. The crank isn't the only
     issue. </li>
 <li>
     Early model 4 cylinder
     applications may use a 2 speed fan. According to GM schematics this fan
     has 2 senders. One sender is a single switch that activates at 235F. The other
     sender has 2 switches that activate at 221F and 246F. The low speed will
     activate when the 221 or the 235 contacts close or when the air
     conditioning is on. High speed will activate only when the 241 contacts
     close.</li>
 <li>
     All repairs to the wiring of
     this sensor MUST be soldered and water proofed. Corrosion of improperly
     repaired joints will result in bogus ECM errors. </li>
 <li>
     The original round connector
     ECT sensor used by the ECM in early Fiero and other GM cars is no longer
     available. The new sensor requires a new connector. This connector is
     included with Borg Warner packages but will need to be purchased
     separately with many others.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Temperature Sensors Vs. Errors in Reporting</h2>

<p>A problem with any Temperature sensor is more sensitive to error as the
temperature increases. </p>

<p>Poor wiring, Carbon build up or cooking can alter the sensor resistance by a
few ohms. At low temperature, a few ohms of error are a small percentage of the
sensor resistance, however as temperature rises the percentage of error
increases as the sensor resistance drops.</p>

<p>The sensor is supposed to be accurate within plus/minus 1 degree C. Any error will affect fuel economy and performance, even with no codes. If we figure the high temperature as 160F(70C) then a 4.44% error is plus/minus 7.104F(3.11C) of error. This can drive the engine rich or lean depending on if the ECM thinks the air is hotter or cooler than it really is.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Note that a bad sensor or wire/plug for that circuit can have a much higher error that 20 Ohms and still not set DTCs that says "Lookout me, I am a bad sensor!"</span>  Examples, code 14 coolant sensor low-voltage will trip at 270F for 3 seconds and code 25 MAT needs a totally dead sensor.</p>
<p>Another Example: The MAT sensor on 87 and up Duke Engine. When this sensor has an
error and intake air temp is up around 130-150F, common during idle, the sensor
is lying to the ECM. The ECM adjusts the fuel mix based on this and if the lie
is big enough you'll get DTC 45 errors before you trip DTC 25...</p>

<p>This is the reason why soldering any connection is required. Most Crimper tools can't make good joints for sensitive sensors. Soldering and Weather Proof heat shrink is good idea for TPS and any other sensors that uses by the ECM. </p>

<h2>MAP</h2>

<p>The MAP, Manifold Absolute Pressure, sensor is used for both fuel mixture and ignition 
timing. It is also used briefly during startup to measure the local barometric pressure, 
which helps the engine compensate for altitude and weather. If this
sensor is batty you will have trouble and it often will not set an error code.</p>

<p>One typical symptom is when you punch the gas and the car
backfires or stumbles.</p>

<p>This first thing you have to do is make sure the sensor
vacuum line is good. It has to be clean inside, have all joints sealed tightly, 
and be connected to the correct vacuum port. Even a tiny
leak will screw up this sensor.</p>

<p>Keep the vacuum line short so that the MAP sensor
will respond instantly to manifold pressure changes. A long vacuum line will
take longer to pass the change in pressure to the MAP. This lag can be enough
to cause a problem. The exact effect depends on the inside diameter of the line
and how long it is.</p>

<p>Don't count on new sensors being good. I've had the
stumbling problem and when I did it was a new MAP sensor that caused it. I
changed the sensor again, this time to Borg Warner product, and the problem
went away.</p>
<h3>Map Test</h3>
<p>This is a basic test described in many manuals...</p>
<p>Measure voltage of the MAP sensor's output terminal (Center terminal of most GM ones) with
 ignition on and engine off. 
Start engine and apply 10 in.(250 mm) Hg to unit, voltage should be 1.2 to 2.3 volts less.
</p>

<h3>What is Absolute Pressure?</h3>

<p>Absolute Pressure means that Zero PSI is referenced to an Absolute Vacuum,
instead of Atmospheric Pressure like your Tire Gauge. Absolute Pressure is used
because it simplifies the engine computer and sensors, especially with
Turbo/Super charging setups.</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolute Pressure is often marked as PSIA, short for &quot;Pounds per Square
Inch, Absolute.&quot;</li>
<li>Atmospheric Pressure is about 14.7 PSIA depending on altitude and weather.</li>
</ul>
