<h1>R134a conversion</h1>

<p>There has been a tremendous volume of material in the forums about
converting Fiero to R134. A big chunk of the posted info is incorrect and some
is dangerous. Hopefully, this article will help sort some of it out.</p>

<p class="warn">Notice! This article is subject to change without notice. I am
still reading GM's and other information on this subject. The version posted is
the most accurate data I have at any given time. There have been many changes
to conversion data over time. New research by the carmakers and others is
released regularly. This article will be updated as information dictates.</p>

<p class="warn">Warning! Improper handling of refrigerants can cause severe
injuries or death. Refrigerants are Oxygen Displacing compounds. DO NOT use
them in confined spaces!</p>

<p class="warn">Warning! Never assume a system is empty when the compressor won't
activate. The system can still contain significant amounts of R12 even when
there is no pressure. This remaining refrigerant MUST be removed from the
system by licensed persons using approved equipment.</p>

<h2>R134a (HFC-134a, DuPont Suva&reg; 134a)</h2>

<p>At present, no
distributor of MVAC components will warrantee parts unless the system is
charged with either R134 or R12, therefore I don't recommend using other
refrigerants even if they are on the EPA approved list. The USEPA DOES NOT
recognize any of the &quot;drop in&quot; refrigerants that supposedly coexist
with remaining R12 in the system. Refrigerant compounds containing Butane,
Propane, or other hydrocarbons are illegal in many places.</p>

<p>The Fiero system will accept R134. Some systems will accept it better 
than others. Just what you need to change depends on the condition of the 
OE system and a few other things.</p>

<h2>R12 vs. R134 performance</h2>

<p>I've run R12 and R134... While some vehicles may not perform as well with
R134, I don't see any problem with using it in Fiero.</p>

<p>Technically R134 is not as good at cooling as R12 but Fiero is so over
refrigerated that this will not matter except maybe in really hot climates. In
my car R134 has the car pretty well cooled down by the time I've gone just 2-3
miles. The only time I run the system full is for initial cool down in 100&deg;
weather. Most of the time the temperature slider sits in the middle. (My car is
black and has a sunroof.)</p>

<p>The biggest part of cooling any car down, Even w/o AC, is dumping the huge
slug of hot air from a parked car. I simply pop the sunroof open to do that.
The car temperature drops really fast that way.</p>

<h3>How over cooled is Fiero?</h3>

<p>The Fiero condenser and evaporator are the same size used in much larger
vehicles. There's enough capacity for at least a good size 4 door and likely a
station wagon.</p>

<p>It's so over cooled that even in hot weather it is difficult to make the V5
compressor run at full stroke. While this makes charging the system a pain,
it's great for fuel economy. The compressor load is hardly noticeable. (Yes,
I've tried GM's official method to get the thing to run full load.)</p>

<p>While the old A6 compressors are easier to charge, you take the full load
every time the clutch slams. I've always hated clutch cycling systems. I'll
take the variable compressors any day, even if they are harder to charge.</p>

<h2>There are 2 main methods of conversion, basic and full. </h2>

<p>Basic conversion is &quot;simply&quot; recovering the R12 and dumping in
R134. This is what most people do when they install the Interdynamics
&quot;conversion kit.&quot; Three of the biggest problems with this method
are...</p>

<ol style="margin-top:0pt" start="1" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal">It
     doesn't remove the old oil. The old oil effects system volume and that
     affects system performance. If you have all the OE oil in the system then
     you have lost about 6 ounces of refrigerant capacity when you charge the
     R134 and it's new oil. The reality is there is no way to know how much oil
     is in there. Some may have leaked out or someone may have added too much
     during previous service work.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">The
     accumulator dryer unit is only designed to last about 7 years and it's not
     compatible with R134. The desiccant will not be able to draw water out of
     the R134 or may release water into the R134. Any moisture in the R134 is
     likely to freeze in the orifice tube and cause problems.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Systems
     with variable displacement compressors may not work right with excessive
     oil in the system. (The DA-V5 used in 87-88 Fiero 4 cylinder cars is such
     a unit.)</li>
</ol>

<p><i>I don't recommend basic conversion for any car.</i> Yes, I know, it's
cheap. This is a &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; deal. At best I'd say
it's 50/50 on getting decent results or having a real mess.</p>

<p>The &quot;Full&quot; conversion, short of replacing everything, is much more
reliable than basic. Assuming your compressor is good, the &quot;Do It
Yourself&quot; cost is between $100-200. The exact total will depend on where
you get the parts. There's quite a variation in price so shop around. (Doesn't
include renting a vac pump.)</p>

<p>In a full conversion, oil is drained from the compressor. The ACC/dryer and
orifice tube is replaced. (The accumulator dryer unit is only designed to last about 7 years.)
It's also a good idea while the system is apart to
replace the Schrader Valves and the O-rings in the various fittings. Replacing
these parts keeps refrigerant in and water out.</p>

<p>The compressor should be removed and drained of old oil. Measure the oil you
get from the compressor. Install the same volume of new PAG or Ester oil into
the suction port. Pour the rest of the oil into the new
accumulator. (No, I'm not getting into oil type. Every time I turn around one
is better than the other. Ester is what NAPA put in their kit. Other kits use
may use either.) </p>

<p>The O-rings are a main source of leaks in the system, along with the
compressor's shaft seal and bad hoses. This conversion method eliminates all
the old O-rings and gives you a chance to really look over the compressor. Make
sure that all the compressor switches and the clutch are in good shape. (Old
Schrader Valves are also prone to leak. See the notes in AC service.) Now is
the time to fix them if they aren't 100%.</p>

<p>Actually, this isn't quite a full conversion. A &quot;real&quot; full
conversion includes upgrading the compressor shaft seal or even replacing the
compressor. Shaft seal replacement is beyond the skills/tools of most people.
However, if the compressor is at all questionable, now is the time to install a
replacement. </p>

<p>A &quot;real&quot; full conversion would also replace the rubber hoses. This
part isn't as important as once thought. It turns out that during its life, the
R12 hose soaks up oil and the oil blocks the R134 from leaking through the
walls. Anytime damaged hose is replaced, it needs to be the new
&quot;barrier&quot; hose or you will lose R134 right thru the hose.</p>

<h2>Charging</h2>

<p class="warn">Warning! R134 operates at higher head pressure than R12.
Overcharging can cause compressor failure and/or system rupture. Don't forget
to include R134 contained in oil charge or sealer cans when counting charge
ounces.</p>

<p class="warn">NEVER charge anything into the high side port of a running
system!</p>

<p>The desired R134 charge is between 80% and 85% of the original R12 
load by weight. Due to minor variations in systems, the best thing to do is
charge to 75% and test. Then bump the charge up a tiny bit at a time until it
works correctly. DO NOT install more than 90% of the R12 charge by WEIGHT! (The
reason I say 75%... If you are doing the basic install then 75% could really be
80% or more of the usable capacity.)</p>

<p>The following table is based on the 40 ounce OE charge in my 87SC. It will
give you the amount of R134 to reach a particular percentage of the R12 charge.
These numbers are only correct for a &quot;full&quot; conversion and a 6 oz
(total) oil load. </p>

<p class="note">Note! GM lists most Fiero at 40 ounces but always check the
charge label on the AC housing in the front compartment. There may be
undocumented variations. The label is silver and blue with the Harrison logo on
it and the location usually makes it difficult to read. (I think some or all
88's may run a lower amount of refrigerant.)</p>

</table>

<p>Now lets say you've done the full conversion using the Castrol or NAPA kit,
you'd load just under three 12 oz cans of R134 to reach 85% of the original
R12.</p>

<p>If on the other hand, you do a full conversion and use the Interdynamics
kit. You have to account for the 3-4 ounces of refrigerant in the oil charge.
You'd install two whole and at most half of the third R134 can. If you also
installed a pressurized sealer, you likely would not need any of the third R134
can. </p>

<p>In either case, you likely end up with some R134 left over. Try to find
someone that can use it. Once a can is opened, they rarely keep long before
they leak out.</p>

<p class="note">Of coarse this assumes you're not wasting refrigerate with sloppy switching cans etc... 
Switching small cans can waste 1-3 oz or more every time one can runs out.
</p>


<h2>Labels &amp; Fittings</h2>

<p class="warn">Warning! Do not try to unscrew conversion fittings! The R134 fittings
have thread locker in them and bond to the R12 fitting after install. Do Not
heat the fittings to release them! See the AC service article for details.</p>

<p class="note">NOTE: Some conversion fittings retain the OE Schrader cores while
others require removal of the OE core. Make sure you know which ones you are
using!</p>

<p>When installing the federally required conversion tag make sure you list
which oil you put in the system. PAG and Ester should not be mixed in the
system. It is easy to forget later what you used unless it is on this label.
The label should be placed in the front compartment near the accumulator dryer
where it will easily be seen by future service persons working on the system.</p>

<p>The R134 speed lock connectors MUST be installed on converted R12 systems in
the USA and Canada. Each refrigerant has it's own federally standardized
connectors. Standardized connectors are required in many NATO countries to
prevent cross contamination of the MVAC system. Use the correct connectors for
your local standards.</p>
<h3>Primary Seal fittings</h3>

<p>Unlike cheap adaptors supplied in many retrofit kits; Primary Seal fittings
have their own valve. You really want to use such a fitting on at least your
high side test fitting. The GM R12 high side valve was prone to leaking and the
problem only gets worse with R134. The R12 valve is not R134 compatible and people
that get away using it for conversions are just lucky and/or waiting for a
future leak there.</p>

<p>The primary seal valves are not very expensive and are available at many
parts stores. Try your local independent or franchise store if you have trouble
getting them thru chains like Pep Boys, Autozone and
others.</p>

<p>Depending on the fitting you purchase, you will probably need to remove the
OE valve before you install it. On the high side fitting I also recommend a
tread sealant like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181142/http://www.supercool.ac/" target="_blank">Supercool</a>
&quot;Refrigerant Leak Lock with Teflon&reg;&quot; (Part No. 7012) available thru
many auto parts stores. The tip of the high side fitting isn't the best sealing
surface for the O ring in the new valve.</p>

<h2>I read about a High Pressure Limit Switch somewhere... </h2>

<p>According to what I've read so far, there is a legal requirement that a new
high-pressure cutoff switch that must be added to many systems. This switch
shuts off the compressor if the &quot;high side&quot; exceeds safe levels. This
is in addition to clutch cycling switches. The switch is intended to prevent
system rupture and the release of refrigerant. (There is already a high
pressure cutoff on 87-88 4 cyl.)</p>

<p>Most Fiero systems should have this switch. If not then you should add one.
The limit switch is not difficult to install and is relatively inexpensive
insurance against frying the compressor or blowing apart the system. Most of
these use a &quot;vampire tap&quot; or T off the high side test port. You will
need the AC wiring diagram for your car to hook it up. </p>

<h2>Alternates</h2>
<h3>USEPA said something is legal?</h3>

<p>What EPA said and what DOT/NHTSA said <strong>IS different</strong>.</p>

<p>USEPA allow many kinds of things included hydrocarbons. Refrigerant
Application doesn't mater to them. Walk in cooler, central air, or your car, it's up to
maker/user of item to decide. Propane, etc, has an R number assign. </p>

<p><strong><span style="font-size:14.0pt;
color:red">BUT</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>DOT/NHTSA bans anything with
hydrocarbons in the mix!</strong> NHTSA allows R12 and R134a in current and old cars. 
(DOT is "upgrading" to a new refrigerant R-1234yf for 2013 but cars with it needs heavier AC systems to avoid fire etc... This doesn't apply here.)</p>

<h3>Anyway...</h3>
<p>I don't use or recommend alternate refrigerants. I'm sure some of them are
performing as claimed but there are many things they don't tell you... Like the fact they 
are flat illegal in many places and anyone that uses flamable products with Propane or 
other hydrocarbon components is just asking for potentially lethal problems.</p>

<p>As I said above, most parts makers will void the warrantee of new parts if
used with anything other than R12 or R134. They can and do test for this. This
is not likely to change anytime soon. The biggest factor for this decision by
the parts folks is cost. It simply cost too freaking much money to deal with
the issues of 50 different refrigerants.</p>

<p>Then there are the issues of supply and service. Availability of some
products is limited and many shops won't service cars with other alternates.
(Refrigerant identifiers will tell the shop what is in the system even if you
don't. Many AC service machines have one built in.)</p>

<p>The biggest problem is that many alternates are blends. When the system
leaks, even a tiny bit a year, the lighter chemicals leak out faster than
heavier ones. This alters the blend and total system performance. There is no
way to know how the altered blend will perform or what damage it might do. </p>

<p>If a &quot;pure&quot; refrigerant like R12 or R134 leaks down, you can add
more and know that the formula is always correct. Once a blend has changed due
to leakage you can't restore to its original formula, which means the only way
to get back to the original is to replace the entire refrigerant charge. This
means a legal AC shop ends up with a bunch of trash refrigerant they must pay
to dispose of. </p>

<p>The majority of recovered R12 and R134 is reused or recycled. Waste from
other alternates is generally treated like poisoned R12 or R134. (Poisoned
means the refrigerant has been contaminated with other refrigerant,
hydrocarbons, or by mixing R12 and R134 in a system.) That means the stuff 
can't be recycled and has to be destroyed
under EPA regulations, usually by incineration, which isn't cheap. </p>


<h2>Miscellaneous </h2>

<p>Do you have an old gauge set that you don't use very often and want to save?
R134 adapter kits are available from a number of sources at about $20-30. The
conversion set is not to be removed once it is installed. </p>

<p>Daily use sets should have the hoses replaced to prevent refrigerant release. 
The new hoses will
be the &quot;barrier&quot; type just like the new AC systems.</p>
