<h1>Cruisin&rsquo; right along....</h1>

<p>I'll add more to this when I have time. It will probably not ever cover the
complete system.</p>

<p>Note: If you have 87-88 L4, you can use an ECM Scanner to test the MFL. The
DIS ECM will report all the switches operation except the brake pedal switch
for the dump valve. Besides checking switch condition, the scanner will tell
you if anything else in the switch wiring is fubar.</p>

<h2>Multi-Function Lever</h2>
<p><img src="cruise/cruisemfl.gif" hspace="12" alt="MFL Function Label"><p>

<p>The Multi-Function Lever contains the switches that operate the Cruise
Control system. Note that the MFL does not contain any other switches. The
actual wiper, headlight beam select, and turn signal select switches are all
inside the steering column.</p>

<p>The Cruise switches are pretty easy to <img width="394" height="185" src="cruise/image001.gif" align="left" hspace="12" alt="C235">test.
Almost any Ohmmeter will work.</p>

<p>C235, shown left, is about the easiest place to test at. This small
connector is along the steering column. It's easier to get at C235 if you drop
the trim panel from under the steering column.</p>

<p>These tests will usually detect a dead switch in the lever <b>but</b> <i>may
not detect a switch with intermittent dropout!</i> Work each test several
times. The meter should always drop to the same point. Wiggle the lever while
doing them as well. It may help you detect damage to the wiring.</p>

<p>Connect the meter across terminals A and B. Turn on the slide switch. The
meter should drop to Zero. Now push the slide to Resume/Accel and release it.
The meter should not move when you do that.</p>

<p>Now connect A and C. You should get Zero on the meter Only when you push the
slide to R/A.</p>

<p>Finally, connect between A and D. with the slide in the On position, press
the Set button. The meter should go to zero.</p>

<p><img width="297" height="211" src="cruise/image002.gif" align="left" hspace="12" alt="MFL Schematic">Here's the schematic of the MFL switches.
There's not much to the thing. Unlike the HL Beam Select and the Wiper switch
that are down in the column, these switches are inside the lever head. They
aren't the most rugged things on earth.</p>

<p>The switches are prone to both wear and dirt issues. Fortunately the same
MFL is used in many GM models and are plentiful both new and used.</p>

<p>The MFL isn't made so it can be repaired. A few people have managed to clean
the switches when they acted up. In most cases you are just better off
replacing the whole MFL. To make that easier, tie a string to C235 before you
pull the wire out. Then use the string to pull the new wire down the column.</p>

<p>Those of you with access to an oscilloscope can use it to test the switches.
You need the scope and a battery. A handy battery is to get a 9 volt
&quot;Transistor&quot; battery and a clip from Radio Shack. The trace should
jump and stay when you push the switch. If it bounces around as you hold the
switch then the switch is shot. (Most volt and ohmmeters don't have rapid
enough response for this test but you can try it with them as well.)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The following parts for the column are confirmed available thru MotorMite's
HELP! Series.</p>

<h2>Servo Notes</h2>

<p>Some people have had luck cleaning the valves on the servo. It's worth a
shot. In most cases you need to replace the servo.</p>

<h3>Vacuum Canister</h3>

<p>Some people repair the metal one. Unless you need to do that for show
reasons, just find an equivalent plastic vacuum ball. You can get them from
almost any car made. There are more notes on this in the vacuum leak article. </p>

<h3>Servo Adjustment</h3>

<p>Notice on the servo there is a plate with a bunch of holes. Use the hole
that allows the servo to completely rest with a slight slack in the cable.</p>

<h2>Dump Valve</h2>

<p>There is a redundant dump valve in most cruise systems. This valve is
mounted near the servo and is on an independent circuit operated by a switch on
the brake pedal. (There are two brake switches for most cruise systems.) Don't
forget to check this valve and its wiring if the servo isn't holding vacuum. To
temporarily disable this valve, plug the large port on the servo. </p>

<p>You should NOT operate the car long term without this valve. The valve makes
the servo dump quickly when the brake pedal is pushed. Without it servo release
is greatly slowed.</p>
