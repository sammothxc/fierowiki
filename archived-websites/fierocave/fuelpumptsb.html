<p class="note">Note: Colder oil is then the longer the pump will run after the engine shuts off. (Example, moving the car from blocking someone else.) 
It's normal in winter in North to see pump run on a few to 30 seconds. Longer, like 1 minute, then check/replace oil pressure sender. 
This can happen with new style oil pressure sender/switch as well.

Subject: FUEL PUMP RUN-ON
Vehicle: 1982-87 VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH FUEL INJECTION

Some vehicles with engines equipped with Throttle-Body-Injection (TBI) or Multi-Port
Fuel Injection (MPFI) fuel systems may exhibit a condition where the fuel pump
continues to run for 3 to 4 seconds after the ignition is shut off.

This condition will most likely occur when a cold engine has been started, run for a
very short time (oil still cold), and shut off.

This condition occurs because some engine fuel systems are wired so that when the
engine oil pressure is above 4 psi, the fuel pump will continue to run via a switch
in the oil pressure sensor.

Customers whose cars exhibit this condition should be assured that their vehicles are
operating properly, and that the fuel control system insures that all fuel pumped to
the engine after shut-off is returned to the fuel tank. NO REPAIR SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED.

If the fuel pump continues to run for significantly longer than 3 to 4 seconds after
the ignition is shut off, refer to Service Manual Vacuum and Wiring
Diagrams/Electronic Fuel Injection/Fuel and Idle Speed Control Wiring Circuit for
wiring information and to section 8A of the chassis service manual for information on
diagnosis and repair/replacement of the oil pressure sensor switch.</pre>
