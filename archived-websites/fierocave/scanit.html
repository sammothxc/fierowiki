<h1>Scannerroid</h1>

<p class="note">You do not need a "Code Reader." Use a small wire connected between
the A and B terminals in the ALDL connector. The check/service engine light
will flash out the codes for you. You don't need any of those 20-30$ readers
you see all over the place. Read ALDL and/or More on Tools.</p>


<h2>ECM scanning for the rest of us.</h2>

<p>Many references to using an ECM scanner show up in the forums... But just
what is a scanner and what the hell do all those bloody number mean?</p>

<p>An ECM scanner is a computer in its own right and plugs into the Assembly
Line Diagnostic/Communication Link connector. Depending on the scanner model
and ECM involved it can do several things but the main ones are retrieving
stored Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC is the formal name for the error codes.)
and reading the Serial Data Stream. It is that second part that sets the
scanner apart from code grabbers or a simple paper clip.</p>

<p>Many people make out like a scanner will instantly tell you what is wrong
with the car. Very simply, it won't. You are going to have to practice reading
and learning the numbers you see on a good engine so you know what to look for
with a problem. Making the best use of an ECM scanner is as much art as
science. If you have a poor grasp of how computer controlled engines work, the
scanner may not help you much. </p>

<p>The main complication is that there's all sorts of things that can make the
ECM feed you bogus data. You can't count on any one thing to tell you what is
wrong. Another problem is that the OBD1 ECM data stream is far too slow to
track fast moving items like O2 voltage and ignition timing. Even the more
modern OBD2 systems have trouble keeping up with some items.</p>

<h2>First you need a scanner...</h2>

<p>If you have a laptop, you can use WinALDL and a special cable... There are
many threads in the forums about it. The people using it like it. This works
only with the older C3 ECMs used with the Fiero V6 and the distributor L4. The
software is a free download far as I know. Someone in the forums sells the
assembled cable if you don't want to make one. 
(WinALDL or The Fiero Store's USB tool <u>will not work</u> on P4 ECM, like 87-88 L4 Fiero.)
</p>

<p>One of the least expensive standalone units is the AutoXray OBD1 GM Only
scanner. (It's been discontinued.) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181129/http://www.autoxray.com/" target="_blank">autoxray.com</a>. And try <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181129/http://www.actron.com//" target="_blank">Actron</a>, you can get their tools 
at any auto parts store. Commercial ones will work on C3 and P4 ECMs, including 87 and up Fiero L4 DIS motors. </p>

<p>I have the AutoXray. It is nice enough for what I need but if you need to
look at several parameters at once it can be a pain. The screen is setup to do
one item at a time. It will track everything but you have to scroll back and
forth to see things.</p>

<h3>Scanning while driving</h3>

<p class="warn">Warning: If you notice that your engine runs significantly different with the scanner
in operation, <i>don't drive the car!</i></p>
<p>The ECM isn't made to be multitasking
and the scanner can mess with the ignition timing, idle RPM, and more, in many configurations of ECM. </p>

<h2>What can I do with it?</h2>

<p>You can learn certain things about how the engine is running and if a change
you made may be causing trouble. This isn't a complete guide but it should give
you some starting points depending what is wrong with the car. What you can
learn from the scanner depends greatly on what ECM is in use. The newer the
ECM, the more it will tell you.</p>

<h3>System Voltage</h3>

<p>The voltage the ECM sees is important. Besides more obvious problems like
weak spark with low voltage, you'll also have injection problems. If the
voltage to the ECM is too low, the ECM will go into a low voltage mode that
changes the entire fuel pulse setup. This is one reason why I keep harping
about checking the charging system and grounds whenever you have poor idle and
other engine problems.</p>

<h3>Idle Setting</h3>

<p>The scanner will tell you where the Idle Air Control motor is positioned. This
can help you nail down small vacuum leaks or incorrect throttle stop settings.
With the car idling in park/neutral, I believe most Port fuel injected engines
should show about 30-35 steps on a hot engine. 700 series TBI units will show
about 10-12 steps on the IAC. I don't have the number for the older 300 series
TBI. (TBI units can't shut the throttle butterfly too much or the fuel won't be
able to get by properly at idle.)</p>

<p>As an example, an Idle count of 3 at idle on a 700 series TBI likely means
there is a significant vacuum leak or some twit has messed with the throttle
stop. A miss adjusted throttle stop can also mess with BLM at idle.</p>

<p>The IAC should stay pretty stable at idle. An IAC that is dancing around
indicates problems. Could be vacuum problems or any number of other things.</p>

<h3>Integrator and BLM </h3>

<p>If you think the car is running rich or far worse lean, these numbers can
help you find out how bad the problem is.</p>

<p>Ideally both numbers should be close to 128. So you know what they do... On
newer cars they are called short term and long term fuel trim respectively.
These numbers tell you how the ECM is setting fuel mix.</p>

<p>Integrator, the short-term fuel trim, will dance around as the car runs. In
many cases it changes too fast to be accurately read on the scanner. If it
strays too far from 128 for too long, the ECM will change the BLM number to try
to get Integrator to stay closer to 128. A car that is running rich will
usually show a low, even pegged, BLM number. A high BLM indicates a lean
problem that could be real bad for the engine.</p>

<p>BLM, Block Learn Mode, the long-term fuel trim, gets its name from blocks of
numbers in the PROM program. </p>

<p>The Integrator will change at nearly every update. BLM should change very
little or not at all as long as RPM is constant, like at idle or cruising down
the highway. BLM will change based on RPM as the engine may need different fuel
trim at 2500 RPM than it does at idle. This is normal. What you never want to
see is BLM pegged at the low or high limit. Pegging BLM is usually a bad thing,
but won't trip an error unless the Integrator also pegs for more than X
seconds. 45 rich mix is the error you get with Integrator pegged low and 44
lean mix is pegged high. </p>

<h4>The numbers are backwards</h4>

<p>As I noted, low numbers mean the car is running rich. On the face of it this
sounds to many people like the car is adding fuel. What the low Integrator or
BLM number means is that the ECM is cutting fuel in response to a rich
condition. A high Integrator or BLM number means the ECM is adding fuel in
response to a lean condition. </p>

<h4>When to worry</h4>
<p><i>Check your fuel pressure?</i> Fuel pressure can mess with BLM...</p>
<p>Pegging low will waste gas and cause drivability problems. Pegging the BLM
high is especially bad as you will run the engine lean and likely burn stuff up
in fairly short order.</p>

<p>The BLM not equaling 128 isn't automatically a problem. There are many
things in the normal operation of a vehicle that will make the BLM move. If it
is a couple notches either way then there usually isn't much problem. For
example, 124-126 could simply be a response to the weather that day making it
need a bit less fuel. On the other hand, a BLM at idle that is always 120 could
mean something like fuel pressure is too high, you have the wrong injector(s)
installed, or you have an injector with a slight leak.</p>

<p>As I mentioned you don't want to see the BLM pegged. The range of BLM can be
fairly narrow. TK in the forums tells me the 
low BLM limit on all the V6 Fiero is 120. The low limit on the 87+ DIS L4 is 112. 
The high limit for most GM engines is 150.
I don't have any more than that. If the BLM is more than 4 to 5 plus/minus from
128 then post in the forums so someone can help you figure it out. A BLM that
is consistently low could be sign of leaking injectors or other problems even
if it isn't pegged. </p>

<h3>Temperature Sensors</h3>

<p>Besides reading temperature sensor values, a scanner and thermometer can
make testing the sensors very painless. Since Fiero allows easy access to the
coolant via the thermostat housing, all you need is a cheap digital meat
thermometer you can find in many grocery stores for about $15. </p>

<p>On a cold engine, key on and engine off... Scan the coolant temp from the
ECM and read the coolant temp in the thermostat neck with a good thermometer.
They should read within a few degrees of each other. Once you do that, run the
engine up to temperature but DO NOT allow it to build pressure in the cooling
system! Repeat the test again. (The second part of the test is much easier if
you have an IR pyrometer. Then you can just cap the system and read the
thermostat housing temperature without opening the system. You can get IR units
for under $100 now.)</p>

<p>Same test can be used for the air and transmission temp sensors on cars that
have them. Due to its location in the manifold, the MAT sensor used on DIS L4
will need to pulled and let it sit in free air a few minutes. A trans temp
sensor will usually read the same temp you would get reading the trans oil pan
with an IR pyrometer.</p>

<h3>Coolant Fan and Cruise Control</h3>

<p>On the later cars with P4 ECM, like 87+ DIS L4, coolant fan management and
cruise control is integrated into the ECM and status of all controls is
reported in the data stream.</p>

<h3>AC control</h3>

<p>In many cars the AC clutch is controlled at least partly by the ECM. The data stream will indicate 
something like "AC Requested" and "AC Clutch En/Disabled." AC Requested means all the switches in the AC system, 
Control Panel, High pressure, low pressure and clutch cycle if you have it, are closed. The final decision is up to the 
ECM and sets AC Clutch Enabled. Normally, ECM sets AC Clutch Enabled as soon as AC Requested signal is High/Active 
but most ECM programs have an AC cutout that activates above some throttle value. (Another reason to make certain 
your throttle cable is actually making the throttle body reach WOT.) This way the AC isn't sucking power and protects 
the Compressor from over rev when you mash the gas. Even the later V5 compressor based AC systems have this ECM control.
</p>

<h2>What you can't do with it</h2>

<p>As noted, things that change rapidly won't be accurately reflected on the
scanner screen. O2 sensor function and Ignition timing are just a couple
examples. Others are less obvious. While you can use it to check the gross
status of the Throttle Position Sensor, the scanner will not reliably tell you
if there is a bad sensor. If the TPS has small dropouts, they may not last long
enough for the scanner to register them. Items like these will need other
testing equipment like a quality voltmeter or shop scope.</p>
