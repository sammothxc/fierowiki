<h1>Terminal Position Assurance</h1>

<p>Many people know that the terminals
of various connectors can be released from the body for service or rewiring.
Many GM/Packard/Delphi connectors have two(2) locks holding the terminal in the
shell/block.</p>

<p>If you look at the <a href="ecmwire_wp.htm">Weather Pack page</a>, 
you'll see I called the back cover Terminal Position Assurance (TPA) and
I told you it makes the connection stronger. Other connectors, like C100 and
C500 also have TPA but it usually a separate part. No matter what type of TPA
is used, you must defeat it before you will be able to release the terminals
from the connector body.</p>

<h2>Bulk TPA</h2>

<p>We'll only cover a couple types of
bulk connectors but you can safely assume most others have some sort of TPA.
The TPA can be automatic like the Weather Pack cover or a separate part.</p>

<h3>C500</h3>

<p>I'll assume you've figured out the
covers on C500 but to summarize... The engine side covers have tabs you
release. Once you take out the two mounting screws, the body side connector has
two ears you squeeze (on the closed end) and then the cover slides off.</p>

<p>Like most bulk connectors, the C500
terminals are secured in the shell by a TPA clip. Before you can release the
terminals, you have to remove the TPA clip. There are 4 TPA clips in C500, two
in each half. Most of the time you can clearly see these but C500 is covered in
grease and dirt... One is shown partly removed from the body half below.</p>

<p><img width="305" height="267" src="ecmtpa/image001.jpg" align="left" hspace="12">To get the clip out... look in the area where
the bolt goes thru. You will usually see at least some of the ends poking thru.
GENTLY work the small ends until you can grab the big end. </p>

<p>Once the clip is out, the terminals
are released by inserting a small wire into the notch next to the terminal face. The release wire should just fit in the notch. If you look at the image, the notch is above each terminal. When the release wire bottoms in the notch, pull the terminal and its wire out the back. </p>

<p>When you push the wire back in. pull
and see if it comes right back out. If it does you flattened the tab too much
and need to bend it out just a hair. </p>

<p>If you have trouble pushing the wire
in with all the grease, GENTLY use a small screwdriver to seat it. Once the
wires are all seated, insert the TPA clip.</p>

<p>Most connectors with flat terminals
use the same method for releasing the individual male and female terminals.
Switch connectors, headlight plugs, and many others. The notable exception are
the MetriPack 150 &quot;Pull to Seat&quot; connectors in the main article,
which force you to cut wire to get them apart.</p>

<h3>Board Edge plugs</h3>

<p>This is one of the board plugs used on some later ECM units, like the
1227748 unit used with the DIS L4 engine.</p>

<p><img width="180" height="136" src="ecmtpa/image003.jpg" align="left" hspace="12">The
Cover of this plug also serves as the TPA. To open the cover, press the two
small latches in the closed end of the body.</p>

<p>Once the cover is off, the terminals are a little tricky. As you look at the
face of the connector body, you will see that the metal terminal forms a C
shape around a small bit of plastic and a square opening. Insert the release
wire into that little hole to release the terminal.</p>
