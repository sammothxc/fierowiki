<h2>88 Fiero</h2>
<p>88 has some changes and uses different proportion valve spec's since 88 uses same Piston size front and rear with no natural bias. Please see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181137/http://www.fiero.nl/forum/Forum2/HTML/109173.html" target="_blank">That Combination Proportional Valve</a> at PFF.</p>
<p>Update: Confirmed, 88 piston is same size but 88 uses a "true" prop valve and limit all rear line pressure. Not just high pressure in 84-87...
Everyone think 88 has 50/50 braking is wrong.

<h2>How the combination valve works...</h2>
<h3>Proportion valve</h3>
<p>Many OE proportion valve doesn't work in most stopping and only use in panic stop
settings. Most people think all bias is done by a valve, the name is Proportion valve after all, but their wrong many
times. Proportion valve think regulator and activate until the line reaches 500-900PSI from the Master Cylinder.
The un-regulated to front brakes gets 1200psi or more.
Prop valve doesn't activate in normal use. Many other ways to give you Bias, Fiero
and most GM models included. In 84-87 Fiero case, only Hydraulics will give you
Bias. If only the valve gives you Bias then when valve is dead then you have no Bias and
likely only warning is car gets spinning around.</p>

<p>Advantage OE prop solution is no valve to blow up. Car has
&quot;natural&quot; bias without a valve to die.</p>

<h4>Why using a valve only in panic stops?</h4>

<p>Think ABS only older... Rear line pressure is high but
rear tire traction is low. Easier to spin out in panic stop when no "valve" to regulate pressure in back. 
Remember... Weight shift to front in braking. In
panic stop, weight in back is low, very low...</p>

<h3>Lawrence Mazza's Notes</h3>

<p>Following text below was from WebElectric Magazine by Lawrence Mazza. 
That site was remove by him but his notes on the combination valve are posted below.
(Ogre added red fluid path to both pictures.) 
</p>
<p class="quote">The pressure 
        regulator, sometimes called a proportioning valve, is part of the 
        combination valve in my car. In addition to reducing the pressure to the 
        rear circuit, it also senses the balance of pressure between the front 
        and rear circuits. I have seen service manuals that describe what these 
        valves do, but I needed to know <i>how</i> they do it. So, I found a 
        combination valve from an <b>'85 Pontiac without ABS.</b> I took it apart and 
        tried to follow the ports to see what the fluid does. I couldn't tell 
        how the rear proportioning took place, so I decided to section the valve 
        to get a better look.
        </p>
<p class="quote">In the picture (click on it for a reference view), you'll see two 
        spools. The one on the top is the pressure differential valve. It is 
        connected between the front and rear brake circuit. In the middle of the 
        spool is an indent that allows space for the warning indicator switch to 
        extend. This spool normally sits in the center of the valve bore and is 
        balanced in this position due to the equal pressure in the front and 
        rear circuits.</p>
<p class="quote"><b><font face="arial narrow"><font size="4"><font color="#808000">Brake 
        Failure</font></font></font></b></p> 
<p class="quote">In 
        the event of a brake failure, this spool shifts to the failed side. If, 
        for instance, the rear brake line springs a leak, there won't be enough 
        pressure build up in the line, and the pressure in the front circuit 
        will shift the spool to the rear circuit side. When the spool shifts, it 
        will raise the pin on the indicator switch, and that will light up your 
        brake warning light (as if having the brake pedal go to the floor isn't 
        warning enough).</p>
<p class="quote"><a href="javascript:makeRemote1()"><img alt="combination valve - 6.1K" src="brakes-cv/cvalve.jpg" lowsrc="cvalvesm.jpg" align="left" border="0" height="197" hspace="7" width="294" title="Fluid Flow in Normal Operation" alt="Fluid Flow in Normal Operation"></a>The smaller spool 
        on the bottom right is the proportioning valve. Its purpose is to reduce 
        the brake line pressure to the rear wheels so that they don't lock up 
        during a panic stop. To understand how it works, follow the fluid as it 
        flows into the valve. Rear brake fluid enters through the port (D) and 
        fills in the proportioning valve chamber (F). As pressure builds up, the 
        spool (G) shifts to the right (in this case, toward the rear of the 
        car). The amount of pressure required to shift this valve is the 
        pressure reduction you will get in the rear circuit.</p>
<p class="quote">But let's say that you have a front brake line failure. Now you will 
        only have the rear brakes to stop you, and it would sure be nice to have 
        <i>full</i> rear braking rather than reduced braking due to the 
        proportioning valve. This is accomplished with the pressure differential 
        valve. As it shifts to the front side of the valve, it opens up a port 
        that circumvents the proportioning valve. You still will have greatly reduce brakes because the fronts 
        are gone, but at least you will have full rear braking power.</p>

<p class="quote">Here, the differential spool (A) has shifted to the front brake circuit 
      because of a pressure failure, causing the o-ring seal (B) to move past 
      the bypass port (C). This allows full pressure from the master cylinder 
      through port D to flow to the rear brake circuit out port E.

<p><strong>That's the only failure mode in most GM, Ford, etc, combination valve. <i>It will not cut off fluid for a leaking circuit.</i></strong> There is a nice explanation and animation of how a normal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181137/http://http//auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake-types/master-brake.htm" target="_blank">Master

<p>This is Very good article on

84-87 is Figure C. 88 is Figure B. Why? 88 uses same piston size front and back but earlier cars have some natural bias w/o prop valve. That also tell you how many vans and trucks variable valves works. (3/12)</p> 


<h2>Parts</h2>
<p>I've never seen a rebuild kit for the combi valve. Try GM Parts for new ones or get a good used one. (Some GM parts dealers, like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181137/http://www.gmpartsdirect.com/" target="_blank">www.gmpartsdirect.com</a>, shows all numbers are avaible to buy as of 1/12.)</p>
<p class="warn">Do not substitute/switch 84-87 and 88 valve.</p>
