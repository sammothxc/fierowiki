<h1>Fiero Alignment</h1>
<p><a href="https://fierowiki.samwarr.dev/api/public/dl/EvpPN0OJ/docs/fierocave-docs/FieroAlignment.pdf" "">FieroAlignment.pdf</a> Current Version: 09/09/13
Reason: Just to make Toe and Notes easier to read. </p>
<p>Vesion is shown at bottom of first page. No Vesion? Old document, junk it and get a current version.</p>

<p>Notes:<br>
Check Tire pressure before any alignment work because one low tire can effect steering. Do not trust any shop for checking inflation pressure before they do alignment work.</p>
<p>Higher highway speeds can/will effect Toe adjustment because More speed then more toe load. GM Spec was written for National Highway Speed Limit, meaning 55MPH. Now some states have 65-75MPH speed limits really means many drivers drives at 70-85. If you set any "toe out" on a machine then it will only get worse to drive. Spec says 0 &plusmn;0.1&deg; tolerance but any &minus;/out is bad on front of Fiero.</p>

<p>Rear Toe is affected by road speed and engine load. A bit of Toe Out might be a good thing but that is not covered here.</p>

<h2>Old toe spec for 84-87 Fiero</h2> 
<p>For reference Old toe is:<br>
Front +0.15&deg; &plusmn;0.05&deg; <u>Per Wheel</u><br> 
Rear +0.15&deg; &plusmn;0.1&deg; <u>Per Wheel</u><br>
