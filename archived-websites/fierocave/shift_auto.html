<h1>I can't move the shifter! </h1>

<h2>(Or I can't remove the ignition key.)</h2>

<p>Before you do anything else... take out the ashtrays and look under the
shifter. The layout of the Fiero center console makes it very easy for trash
and change to get in or under the shifter. It's hard to see/reach under there
so you'll likely need to remove the shift surround...</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Factory
     shift knobs are held in place by a clip on the front. Just pull out the
     clip</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">4
     screws under the ashtrays hold down the Shift Surround. (Factory screws
     have 7mm heads.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Clean and Lube</h2>

<p class="warn">DO NOT use oil and solvents on plastic jacket cables or plastic
bushings!</p>

<p>The oil may seem to make things better in the short term but it will hold
dirt and work it in even deeper. Whatever problem you were trying to fix will
usually return and be even worse in the not distant future. Oil and solvents
could swell the plastic or make it brittle. (Or Worse... Some solvents could
eat the plastic.)</p>

<p>Plastic bushings and cable jackets are supposed to be used dry. If you wish
to lubricate these types of parts, use a &quot;dry&quot; Teflon spray. These
products will evaporate leaving just the Teflon behind. The Teflon won't
draw/hold dirt in the parts and there won't be any solvent/oil left to damage
the plastic.</p>

<p>To clean the plastic parts, try soap and water. Simple Green, citrus based
cleaners and things like this will get dirt off without damaging the plastic.
If you cannot easily wash the part, use something like Alcohol that will
evaporate easily.</p>

<p>On plastic parts that do get lubricated, like the stem in the shift lever,
use &quot;White&quot; Lithium grease or brake grease. These won't damage
plastics.</p>


<h2>Nothing in there jamming it... Now what? </h2>

<p>These problems usually won't be an interlock cable out of adjustment. Once
these are adjusted at the factory they are usually good for the life of the
car. </p>

<p>The interlock cable is pretty reliable. If it should some how get out of
adjustment then it could hang up the shifter button or the key. The adjuster
for this cable is on the front side of the shifter hardware. Before you mess
with it, note/mark where it starts off, as you may need to return it to that
position later.</p>

<h3>Check for a bad T knob.</h3>

<p><img align="left" src="shift_auto/image002.gif">There
is a plastic lever inside the factory T knob. When you push the button, it
pushes this lever, which then pushes a stem down the shift lever. Sometimes
this little lever breaks or wears out. When broken it obviously won't be able
to push down the stem but it can also jam so that the stem can't pop up. If the
stem can't pop up then you won't be able to remove the ignition key.</p>

<p>To check it, take the knob off. To shift the car, push directly on the
plastic stem that goes down thru the lever. (Be careful you don't damage the
stem.) To make it easier, use a coin on top of the stem.</p>

<p>Note that if you have a leather T knob, you can use parts from the plastic
version to fix it. Just take out the clip that holds the button and everything
should drop right out.</p>

<h3>Check the Stem</h3>

<p>I've not seen it happen but it's possible for the stem that runs inside the
shift lever to break or get dislocated on the bottom. Either one will jam the
shifter and maybe the key. </p>

<p>If the stem is messed up, check the gate hardware carefully. If something is
bent there, it could break/jam again even if you put in a new stem.</p>

<p>For reference... The stem in my factory shifter is 173mm long.</p>

<h3>If you still can't move the shifter...</h3>

<p>Disconnect the shift arm or cable bracket from the transmission. This is
often better for the cable than trying to remove the cable from the arm. If the
shifter moves now, you've likely got a transmission or transmission cable
problem.</p>

<p>If it still will not move, the shifter hardware/cable has problems, the
interlock cable could be out of adjustment, or there is a problem at the
ignition switch. </p>

<p>Again, it would be pretty strange for the interlock cable to go out of
adjustment but it is possible. A more likely culprit is something in the
shifter hardware is worn or bent. If the wear/bend is slight, you may be able
to compensate by tweaking the interlock cable a couple teeth one way or
another.</p>

<p>Other than breaking completely, I've never seen a problem on the ignition
switch hang up the cable but it is possible, especially if someone messed up the
switch during steering column work.</p>

<h3>If you still can't remove the key...</h3>

<p>Does the key release if you wiggle the shifter? If this is the case then try
adjusting the transmission cable. If this cable is a hair off it can keep the
gate from dropping all the way into the park slot. That in turn prevents the
key from releasing.</p>

<p>It could be a binding pin in the interlock head. On rare occasions the
spring on the pin could fail to extract the pin from the switch. More likely is
that the problem is something in the column like a bad ignition lock. The
ignition lock is a pretty common failure item.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>When the shifter is in park, the gate will drop into an extra deep slot and
unlock the ignition so you can remove the key. Only the park slot is deep enough
to release the key. (The &quot;blank&quot; position really does exist. It
prevents you dropping from reverse to park without pushing the button.)</p>

<p><img src="shift_auto/image004.gif"></p>

<p>In the next drawings, we see the ignition switch end of things. First, the
Car is running with the shifter in any position other than Park. See how the
lock pin is pushed into the ignition slide by the interlock cable. The slide
motion is now restricted to the checkered area of its gate slot.</p>

<p><img src="shift_auto/image006.gif"></p>

<p>With the Transmission in park, the Interlock Cable has moved off the pin and
it has popped out of the switch so the Key can be removed or turned to ACC.
Notice that in this position the pin is now blocked from entering the switch.
This also keeps the shifter gate locked so you can't move the lever from park.
It won't even let you press the button.</p>

<h2>Interlock Head Removal or Repair </h2>

<p>If it becomes necessary to remove the interlock head from the ignition
switch, there are two very small screws that you need to remove. When these
screws are removed the cable head slides up and off the switch. Use great care
when removing the cable head. DO NOT hit the shifter if the cable is still
connected to the head! There is a plastic cap that holds the lock pin and a
rather strong little spring in place. The glue holding the plastic cap tends to
be weak and if it doesn't come apart during removal, it will come apart if you
hit the shifter. Once you get the cable off, put the head into a plastic bag,
along with the pin, spring, and cap, if it fell apart. </p>

<p>Note: The screws that hold the interlock to the switch are #1 Phillips
heads. That's the fine one in most screwdriver sets.</p>

<p>If the cable head does come apart, and you manage not to lose any pieces,
you can glue the cap back down with some of the 2 part epoxy style plastic
cement. (Such as Versachem Plastic Welder.)</p>

<ol start="1" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Remove the tan interlock head
     from the cable by depressing the black tab on the cable. </li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Clean all the parts. </li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Apply glue SPARRINGLY in 2-3
     places on the lip in the head opening. Don't get sloppy with this
     adhesive. It's Very strong, and sticks to most hard surfaces. </li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Put the spring on the pin
     shank. </li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Drop the pin and spring in
     the hole, fat end first. </li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Put the cap in place and hold
     it down until the glue sets. This takes about 5-10 minutes. </li>
</ol>

<p>The cable is now good as new, and won't easily come apart again. </p>

<p><b><i>If you do lose parts, or otherwise can't fix the cable head, then
replace the interlock. It is far too easy to leave the car out of park without
this interlock. Leaving the car out of park can result in personal injury
and/or property damage. It could even kill some one.</i></b> The interlock head
can be removed from the cable so if you are getting a used part from the
salvage yard you don't need to dig out the whole cable. I don't know if the
interlock head is available as a separate part from GM. You may have to get the
whole cable from them.</p>
