<h1>Weather Pack connectors</h1>
<p>Our first image shows an exploded view of a two terminal Weather Pack connector. These connectors are available in 1, 2, 4 Flat, 4 Square, and 6 terminal configurations. There are also 3 terminal sensor connectors like the one used for the MAP sensor.</p>

<p>Delphi calls the hinged rear cover, shown closed here, &quot;Terminal Position Assurance.&quot; The cover makes sure the terminals are fully seated and increases resistance to terminal pull out.</p>
<p>On larger Weather Pack connectors, like the Neutral Safety switch, you may run into a white &quot;peg&quot; stuffed into the connector latch. Delphi calls the peg &quot;Connector Position Assurance.&quot;  The peg prevents accidental disconnection from something hitting the latch.</p>

<p>Our final image shows the terminal in more detail. The female terminal is essentially identical except for the contact area. For those who may wonder, yes, you can put the &quot;wrong&quot; terminal in a shell. The MAP sensor connector does just that. It has 3 male pins in a female shell.</p>

<h1><a name="pts">Metri-Pack "Pull to Seat"</a></h1>

<p>Old way: Crimp connector on wire then stuff connector and wire into body.</p>
<p>"Pull to Seat" way: Push wire thru body, crimp connector, and then pull wire back. Like this:</p>
