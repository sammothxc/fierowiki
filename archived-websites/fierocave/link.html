<h1>More Reading</h1>

<p>I'm sure I've duplicated a number of these. This page is mainly to consolidate
many of the links I keep using in the forum or in cave articles. Note: Links will open
in their own window.</p>

<p>When shopping for parts, always keep in mind that many Fiero parts are
common to other GM cars. You should be using specialty dealers like Fierostore
as a last resort for engine and chassis parts. Other people, like Rodney, make
parts that are better than OE. Rodney's Stainless Steel crossover pipes for the
V6 are one example.</p>

<p>When tool shopping, I always buy good tools but I also ask myself &quot;how much
will I use this?&quot; If it's something that will be rarely used, I don't get
Snap-on or Craftsman... The extra cost doesn't make sense for a tool I'll use
once every few years at most. Odds are good the thing will get lost before I
wear it out.</p>

<h2>Parts &amp; Info </h2>

<p>I combined these categories because many parts sites also have a wealth of
information.</p>
<p><a title="Go to the Fiero Forum" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.fiero.nl/">Pennock's Fiero Forums</a></p>


<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.motorage.com/" target="_blank">Motor Age</a> is one of
the trade publications. Motorage was recently relaunched. It appears that most of the stuff once 
linked here has vanished. I don't know if or when any of the old articles will return.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.motor.com/" target="_blank">Motor Magazine</a>, another
trade publication, articles are downloadable in PDF format. There are several
years worth of back issues online. There are just to many good articles to try
and list them here.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.babcox.com/" target="_blank">Babcox</a> is another
source of trade publications.</p>

<p>Here's a guy with what has to be the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.fierosails.com/" target="_blank">largest
collection of Fiero links</a> I've seen. If you can't find it there, it may not
exist. (If you find any new ones for him or bad links in the list, E-mail him.
He does try to keep that list current.)</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://web.archive.org/web/20060525224246/http://www.euronet.nl/users/fo_elmo/fiero.htm" target="_blank">Fiero
Tech Zone,</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.fieros.de/" target="_blank">Oliver's Fiero Pages</a> have got numerous service articles and
other info. Frans and Oliver have &quot;scan tools&quot; that works with a laptop. I
haven't used either... I don't have a laptop so bought a standalone unit.</p>

<p>Changing tire sizes? The Garage at
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.miata.net/" target="_blank">Miata.Net</a> and 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.secret-secret.com/turbo/DIY/tirecalc/turbotire.html" target="_blank">The Turbo! Saab tire size calculator!</a> will tell you 
how far off the speedometer and other things will be. The Miata.Net caclulator 
is more up to date and handles rims up to 23 inches in diameter!</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.v8archie.com/" target="_blank">V8 Archie</a> is
considered the leading expert in putting V8 motors in Fiero.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.rodneydickman.com/" target="_blank">Rodney Dickman</a>
has some very nice parts and tools for repairs and conversions. Good stuff,
decent prices, and shipped quickly. I don't know of anyone that doesn't like
this guy's stuff. If I can't find something thru a regular parts store or GM
dealer, he's the next place I check.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.suspension.com/" target="_blank">Suspension Restoration
Parts Co.</a> has all the polyurethane bushings at good prices. He's where I
got my cradle and dog bone bushings. </p>

<p>If you are after a GM part number try <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.gmpartsdirect.com/" target="_blank">GM Parts Direct</a>. Also call GM/Pontiac dealers in your area. Many of them have old stock of
things long after GM has discontinued it. Note: GMPD is best if you are ordering multiple items. Make sure you understand their shipping policy. Their shipping charges can be fairly stiff and if you aren't careful you will get pounded. (Even with shipping many parts cost less than at local dealers or Fierostore.) </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.rbinc.com/" target="_blank">MotorMite/Dorman</a> has all
sorts of parts and some tools. They are finally building a web catalog of their products.  
You may still need to use their
Master Catalog or the smaller books to locate what you're after. The red HELP!
line carries more stuff than I can begin to list. Then you've got BODY-TITE and
a bunch of others. When you think only a dealer has it, try these people.
(Note: Allot of parts stores don't list these products in the computers. You'll
need the catalogs. Also helps to take the bad part with you for physical
comparison.)</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.jet-hot.com/" target="_blank">Jet-Hot</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.techlinecoatings.com/" target="_blank">Tech Line Coatings</a>
make exhaust and other metal coatings. Jet-Hot will coat things for you. Tech
Line makes products for DIY and Pro use. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.airsept.com/" target="_blank">Airsept</a> has some very
interesting stuff for the Cooling and AC systems. I'm not sure where you can
buy them. Some of it is likely available thru vendors at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.aircondition.com/" target="_blank">Aircondition.com</a>, which 
is probably the best starting place for tracking down AC info, tools, and other
things.</p>

<p>For cooling system info, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.imcool.com/" target="_blank">imcool.com</a>
has just about everything covered. They've done several articles on DEXCOOL.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.txchange.com/" target="_blank">Transmission Exchange Co.</a>
has parts, rebuild kits and TransGo shift kits.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.lislecorp.com/" target="_blank">Lisle</a> has an online
catalog but they do not sell direct to the public. Their tools are sold thru
many parts stores and some of the sources that follow.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.toolsusa.com/" target="blank">Tools USA</a> a tremendous
collection of hand and air tools.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.thexton.com/" target="_blank">Thexton</a> has tools and
some electrical and brake items of interest. They have bleeder repair sets for
when you have a good caliper that just had to snap the bleeder off.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.imperialinc.com/" target="_blank">Imperial</a> has tools
and parts. Good collection of Weather Pack parts including a terminal crimper.
They are more targeted at fleet owners.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.autoxray.com/" target="_blank">AutoXray</a> makes nice
standalone ECM scanners that won't bankrupt you. I've got one of their older
model OBD1 GM only scanners. You can get them thru a number of outlets,
including Eastwood.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.eastwoodco.com/">Eastwood</a> mainly
specializes in refinishing tools and supplies. They are the main source of the
Hot Coat &quot;home&quot; powder coating materials some forum members have purchased.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.spx.com/" target="_blank">SPX Corporation</a> is the parent
Company of OTC, Robinair, and Kent-Moore, as well as allot of other companies
in the auto industry. Many GM dealer tools come from Kent-Moore, Robinair is
one of the best-known AC toolmakers, and OTC brand tools are available thru
many auto parts stores.</p>

<h2>Motor Vehicle Standards &amp; Enforcement</h2>

<p>For a start, here are the official standards from the Fed's.
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?browsePath=Title+49%2FSubtitle+B%2FChapter+V%2FPart+571%2FSubpart+B&amp;granuleId=CFR-2000-title49-vol5-part571-subpartB&amp;packageId=CFR-2000-title49-vol5&amp;collapse=true&amp;fromBrowse=true" target="_blank">Index of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards</a> will take
you directly to the current standards used by the National Highway
Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To get full text you need DL 237MB zip file at top of page... PDF and XML now is just a summery. Site will take 2-5 minutes to start the DL.<br>This Cave file is rip from that huge file... <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://fierocave.home.comcast.net/CFR-2000-title49-vol5-part571.pdf">CFR-2000-title49-vol5-part571.pdf (4.1MB)</a></p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/" target="_blank">NHTSA</a> is responsible
for deciding how to interpret FMVSS. If you have questions about a standard, contact
them. Otherwise you could have problems that fall under the next several links.</p>

<p>Do you run a repair business, car dealership, or market car parts? Here are
the locations of some Federal laws that regulate your business and
modifications that you make to customer cars. These are some of the items
involved with enforcement of the FMVSS rules. (These are from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150226101725/http://www.law.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Legal Information Institute</a>
at the Cornell Law School)</p>
