<h1>Fuzzy Fusing</h1>

<h2>Can You Smell That Smell?</h2>

<p>The first thing you'll notice about fusible links in most cars is that they
aren't covered in normal insulation. It's some sort of rubbery stuff that
smokes like crazy when a link burns out. It's made to do just what it does and
as much as it smokes, it's not likely to set the car on fire... The insulation is specifically made to stay
together when the link fries. That way the remaining pieces shouldn't be able
to short against something else.</p>

<p>Most links also have some type of label to identify them. In U.S. made cars
the words &quot;Fusible Link&quot; usually appears on the wire insulation.
(Insulation markings may also include the link wire gauge.) Many have a tag
molded onto them or into an over sized insulator at one end.</p>

<p>On some import vehicles, they use stamped metal fuse links. These are
screwed down in a large terminal block under the hood. Many newer cars do away
with the traditional fusible links completely. They use various types of large
cartridge fuses instead.</p>

<p>No matter what size type or style they are they must be installed and sized
correctly. <b>You must never replace one with normal wire!</b></p>

<h2>The Missing Link</h2>

<h3>An end broke off a good link... A link burned... etc...</h3>

<p>Replace it. Replace it. Replace it. Shortening the link will change its
calibration. There is no other acceptable repair but replacing the defective
link.</p>

<h3>Installing a new link</h3>

<p>As I warned you in the main article, you must use crimp terminals to install
new links. Replacement links are cheap and available thru most parts stores.
They nearly always come pre cut and stripped. Do Not alter them! Always
remember that the current rating of a fuse link it determined by both the wire
size and the length. If you shorten the link then its current rating goes up
and that's a bad thing for a fuse.</p>

<p>You've got to keep water out of them. Due to their construction, Fuse links
tend to rot even faster than regular wire when soaked. Instead of rotting all
the way thru, they usually rot part way and then blow out. (Often right about
the same time you need some small thing like headlights or the radiator fan.)</p>

<p>When repairing fuse links in the engine bay, I strongly recommend crimp
terminals that come with weatherproof heat shrink tubing on them. These cost
more but will seal out water to prevent corrosion of the wire. The weatherproof
tubing is lined with hot melt sealer. Don't forget to degrease the wires to get
the best seal.</p>

<p>Some replacement links come with ends crimped on. Other people may not be
able to get the weatherproof stuff. Regular insulated terminals can be packed
with RTV silicone or Dielectric grease to keep out water.</p>

<h3>Link spec's</h3>
Four gages smaller than the protected circuit and approximately 10 inches long.
This allows 1/2in on each end for connections.

<h3>No Solder?</h3>

<p>NO! No Solder. Solder have problems because Most people have very poor to no soldering skills, like use way too much solder to make a joint and any extra solder can/will wick along the link effectively shortens the link.</p>

<h3>Should there be a Fuse Link in a ground wire?</h3>

<p>Normally cars are not built that way however to reduce inventory many
companies build all battery cables as &quot;positive&quot; assemblies. (This
includes AC Delco.) This means that cables for the battery ground may have a
fuse link in the thin wire on them. This doesn't usually cause a problem so
just use the cables as made. </p>

<h2><a name="locat"></a>Fuse link sizes and location</h2>

<p>Fiero fusible links are metric like nearly everything else. That means wire
size is measured by the cross sectional area of the conductor in square mm. The
following table is pulled from GM diagrams and some vehicle inspection. </p>

<p>A, B, E, and F are connected to the distribution terminal. This is
under C500 in 1985-88 models.</p> 
<p>1984 Fiero, A and B on starter and F on alternator/battery.</p>

<p>Size of Link A may vary by year/model/options. Later models are 1, older
ones are 2, No I don't know exactly when they changed. All 87's show 1 in their
drawings. If in doubt use a 1 sq mm link.</p>

<p>Link B goes to Red wire in 85-86 models and Red/White wire in 84, 87-88 models. Made harder to tell which is Link A and B in older cars.
If wires are both plain red then go by wire size. Link B is connected to the smaller wire.
</p>

<p>C and D are in the front compartment on the left inner fender between the brake MC and the tire support wall. These are
cascaded below Link B.</p>

<p>According to older drawings, Link E is either 3 or 5. I can't imagine any
Fiero using a 5 in the alternator feed. That has to be a typo. My 87SC L4 runs
a 100-amp CS130 alternator and still only uses a 3. (The &quot;rule&quot; of
fuse links is that they are supposed to be 4 (four) sizes smaller than the wire
they are protecting. The wire to the alternator is 8 sq mm. According to the
link rule a 5 sq mm link is way too big.) I left it there since it shows up in
multiple drawings like that.</p>

<p>G is on the starter solenoid. It is not used in all years. (Good thing. This
was always a crappy place for them.)</p>

<p>H is in C500. You will need C500 pin, wire, and fuse link, to repair it. (It isn't used
with DIS motors.) Wire it as:</p>

<p><img width="296" height="69" src="ecmwire_fl/image001.gif" title="Link repair diagram" alt="Link repair diagram"></p>

<p>The battery link isn't installed from the factory. AC Delco replacement
cables come with a 2 installed so I listed it for reference. Adding this link
isn't a bad idea... This way you have some extra protection if you drop a
wrench against the main lugs or the back of the alternator.</p>

<h3>Emergency replacements</h3>

<p><b>Always use the Metric sized links when possible! </b>The problem of
course is you might have a hard time finding metric fuse links at many parts
stores.The table below lists the AWG links that can safely replace a
metric link in an emergency.</p>

<p>These sizes are based on a table from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181225/http://www.tnt-audio.com/" target="_blank">TNT
Audio.</a> The U.S. (AWG) sizes are as close as you can get and not go over the
metric size. <b>These links may not carry the full load of the OE links! Using
the exact Metric size is always preferable to the alternate.</b> (In a pinch,
it is ok to install a smaller fuse in a circuit but never a bigger one. This is
just the opposite of regular wire where you can always use a heavier gauge than
the original.)</p>

<p>I listed two AWG numbers for the 2 sq mm because the 14AWG wire is very
slightly heavier than 2 mm<sup>2</sup>. (For the others, the next AWG size
larger was much larger, which is unacceptable.) </p>

<h2><a name="tblock"></a>More about the Main Terminal Block</h2>

<p>Here's a rough map of the lines with fuse links and how they are connected
to the main terminal block. </p>

<p><img src="ecmwire_fl/image002.gif" title="Fuse Link Diagram" alt="Fuse Link Diagram"></p>

<p>Note that the lug on the alternator and ECM wires spans both terminals. Even
if both wires break/burn off that lug, you have to keep the remaining piece.
(Or make something to replace it.) You'll have to use regular ring terminals on
the replacement fuse link(s) to connect them to the terminal block. </p>

<p>Many people run accessory loads directly off the battery. The correct
location for these loads is really the main terminal block. Heavy loads go to
the large lug. Lighter loads can go to either. <strong>No matter which lug is used
the new equipment MUST have it's own fuse(s)!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> ECM "Reset connector" (C501) moves depending on which engine and year of car. 
Only 84 Fiero ECM reset connector is different, Alldata/84FSM says C501-LH Rear Of Engine, IE <u>on</u> the motor.
All other Fiero should be as shown below, C501-Near Battery Junction Block.</p>
