<h1>Shock treatment anyone? </h1>

<p>So you're thinking about altering the charging system in one way or
another... Did you make sure your existing parts are all working? Don't touch
anything until your present charging system has been completely tested by a
qualified technician. (These tests should include testing with everything in
the car turned on at various engine RPM. Preferably with the engine hot.)</p>

<p>If the battery, cabling or alternator you already have are crappy then you
will have problems. If you swap the alternator and don't fix a wiring problem
then you will continue to have issues with the new alternator. If you cram in a
bigger alternator then it may temporarily give you more power but the defective
wiring will continue to rot until the whole mess fails completely. Often with
ugly and dangerous side effects.</p>

<p>The most common reasons for using something besides what came with the
car...</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0pt" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">You
     checked the system, everything works ok, but you have a power shortage.
     (Such as when the car came with a 60-amp Alternator but you just added Fog
     and Driving Lights.)</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">You
     fried the old alternator. You want something more reliable. (Installing
     another alternator based on 30-year-old technology is just silly.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Either of those is a good reason to change to a different alternator. The
problem is that many people think all you need is the newer/bigger alternator.
Many times they get away with it but there are plenty that don't. When the new
alternator doesn't solve the problem, the world gains more bald car owners.</p>

<h2>Hey Toto, This Ain't Kansas Anymore</h2>

<p>As Dorothy found out, when you screw with stuff you don't understand, you
get stuck in Oz. Most people, even many professional auto service people,
don't fully understand the charging system. It looks so simple and in many ways
it is for day-to-day things. When you start talking about altering the system
things become amazingly complicated Very Fast.</p>

<p>Before you alter the power system in any way, you've got to know how much
juice a car is drinking. Throwing parts at it doesn't automatically solve your
problem. You could actually make things worse. This includes changing pulleys
as well as the alternator or battery. </p>

<p>Bigger is better? People assume that throwing in a larger alternator will
always solve a power shortage. This simply isn't true. Even the biggest
alternator available may not meet demand under all conditions. People
constantly forget that the Peak rating usually quoted for an alternator often
IS NOT the same as actual output. </p>

<p>And everyone, including me at times, forgets how the battery plays into
this. It's not entirely dead weight once a car is running. There are times when
the car pulls power off the battery even when the engine is running. A bad or
undersized battery can affect all aspects of vehicle operation.</p>

<p>The things in this article are even more true of today's electric everything
cars. Many cars today are tight on power right from the factory even with the
largest alternators available. Adding high wattage aftermarket items to many
current models can create major problems.</p>

<h2>Got Amps?</h2>

<p>The right way to determine the load on the alternator and battery is to use
a current probe and measure the actual loads under various conditions. That is
time consuming and beyond what we need for this article. The fact is most
people find out there is a problem because they keep sucking down the battery
or frying alternators. (And they don't have the tools to do the testing
anyway.)</p>

<p>Now a car obviously doesn't draw full output from the alternator at all
times but there are times when it can draw that and more. Most cars can sustain
this high load very easily. To make things more complicated, the alternator
output is <span style="font-style:italic;">not constant</span> and varies greatly between Idle and Peak. Most
alternators are sized to peak above the maximum the car will use but they don't
provide this amount full time. If the alternator can't meet demand then the
power is sucked from the battery until either the load is reduced, the
alternator is again spinning fast enough or the battery dies.</p>

<p>We want to figure a good heavy load so say it's a hot evening and you've got
the AC on. It's getting late so you hit the lights. For simplicity we'll assume
a factory installed alternator and new battery. Obviously if the battery is
shabby it will simply magnify any problems. Using some quick info from
Oliver's, AC Delco, and other sources, lets figure the following for a notch
back:</p>

<table border="1">

</table>

<p>Note<br>
1. ACDelco Rad Fan Part # 15-8498 spec is 150 watts / 14 volt = 10.72 Amps.

<p>In the table above we blow over 30 amps and that's not even all the stuff
that's running. The dash only included the gauge back lighting. I left out the
stuff in the radio, switches, etc that is probably a few more amps. </p>

<p>If the AC is on high, AC Delco says it typically draws 14 amps, which bumps
the above total to 39 amps.</p>

<p>And we haven't even included the power the engine eats in the ECM, fuel
system, ignition, and so on that is likely another 15-20 amps. </p>

<p>What's the V6 aux fan draw in those cars? 6-8 amps? More?</p>

<p>Hit the brakes? That's good for another 8 amps. It's not a constant load but
it still counts.</p>

<p>A GT is going to be a little different from a 4 cyl notch back but as you
can see, it's very easy to draw 45-50 amps just with stock components. Throw in
any aftermarket stuff like stereo, fog lights, whatever, and you go up fast
from there.</p>

<h2>And that relates to the power system how?</h2>

<p>Everything in the car MUST fit in the parameters the charging system was
built to. Keep in mind that most cars are built with the smallest alternator
that will run the stock equipment without killing the battery at every traffic
light. If you add power hungry stuff to the car, you may have to replace the
alternator even if it's otherwise perfectly good.</p>

<p>The alternator and battery are a balancing act. When the alternator output
drops below what the car needs, the rest of the power is pulled off the
battery. Exactly when you run into a power shortage depends what you have
turned on at any given time and how fast the Alternator is spinning.</p>

<p>Note: We're going to mention RPM in a second. Whenever you see
&quot;<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ARPM</span>&quot;
we'll be talking about <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="font-weight:bold;">A</span>lternator shaft <span style="font-weight:bold;">RPM</span></span> not
Engine RPM. </p>

<p>AC Delco's technical notes indicate most alternators only produce 40% of
their peak at idle. According to other AC Delco specs, most alternators don't
peak until 5000-6500 ARPM. (GM specifies all peak numbers at 6500 ARPM
regardless of when actual peak is reached.) The alternator in a stock setup is
spinning about 2x Engine RPM. So if the engine idles at 850 RPM, the alt is
spinning about 1600-1700 ARPM. </p>

<p>For an example, figure that the biggest stock 12-SI alternator with 94 amps
peak only makes about 40 amps at 1600 ARPM and doesn't make peak output until
about 5000 ARPM... (This is the biggest OE one in 85-87 V6.) Figuring the alt
spins about 2X engine speed this means that you loosing alternator power any
time the engine drops below about 2500RPM. </p>

<p>If you did something like install an &quot;under drive&quot; pulley, you
could have an even bigger problem. Now the thing is turning even slower at idle
and you will not be able to reach peak alternator output until higher engine
RPM. When you figure most cars cruise the highway at 2200-2500 RPM, the under
driven alternator may <span style="font-style:italic;">never</span> make peak output under normal driving. (How
much of a problem, if any, would depend on exactly how much you under drive the
alternator.)</p>

<p>If you have the smaller 66 or 78 amp 12-SI then it gets even worse. At idle
these alternators only make around 30 amps. Even in a non-AC car, these
alternators may not keep up with even a few added amps of load. Under driving
one could be suicide.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181128/http://oljeep.com/gw/alt/Alternator_Theory.html" target="_blank">Joe Guilbeau's Alternator Theory Page</a> has most GM Alternators and Amp Charts.</p>


<h2>Battery &quot;Reserve Capacity&quot;</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Reserve Capacity (in Minutes)</dt><dd>How long battery will last at 80&deg;F with 25A load before the charge is below 10.5 volts.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This is important! Don't automatically assume that an alternator is too
small because the car draws more than it makes at/near idle. It <span style="font-style:italic;">depends
greatly</span> on how much over you are AND how much you idle vs. cruise. If you
are mostly cruising and hitting a few stoplights, you should never have a
problem. If you often idle or creep along because of allot of heavy traffic
then you might have something to worry about.</p>

<p>This is where an often-overlooked battery specification comes in handy. The
&quot;Reserve Capacity&quot; rating of the battery tells you how long the
battery can run a 25-amp load by itself without dropping dead. The main reason
for the Reserve Capacity specification is to give you an idea of how far you
can drive if the alternator croaks. Of coarse how far you will really get
depends on various things but at least you know battery X might get you a
little farther than battery Y. It's one more way you can compare two products
against each other at the store. (In the U.S. this is standard across the
industry.) This specification can also give you a rough idea of how long the
car would be ok if you are some amount over the alternator output at idle.</p>

<p>Let's say you have a car that is over the alternator by 5 amps at idle.
You've got a battery with a 60-minute Reserve Capacity specification. At this
rate the car could idle for hours and not wipeout the battery. On the other
hand, if you were way over you could have trouble in less than an hour. A battery
with longer reserve capacity would buy you more time.</p>

<p>In the case where you are 5 amps over, you wouldn't need to increase
alternator capacity. Most cars are at least this much over at idle. Many are
more.</p>

<p>In cases where you are regularly wading thru traffic and pulling 20 amps or
more than the alternator makes at idle then you might want to consider changing
the battery, the alternator, or both.</p>

<h3>Who would idle a car for an hour?</h3>

<p>Normally you wouldn't do that intentionally to most vehicles. The problem
usually comes up when you are in traffic that is creeping along at 5-10 MPH.
You could easily spend an hour or more in such traffic, which could be enough
to kill the battery. When caught in sluggy traffic it's a really good idea to
cut off auxiliary lights, big stereo systems, and anything else you don't need
unless you are sure the charging system can handle it. (This even applies to
many new vehicles!)</p>

<h3>Would a &quot;bigger&quot; battery help?</h3>

<p>It might. Obviously there are physical limits on space but the &quot;Reserve
Capacity&quot; specification can vary considerably between products even in
batteries of the same &quot;group.&quot; (Battery &quot;Group&quot; defines
standardized physical properties for the case. OE Fiero uses Group 75
batteries.) </p>

<p>Again, it depends how far over you are at/near Idle. Up to 15-20 amps a
battery with more &quot;Reserve Capacity&quot; may be all you need. Beyond that
I'd consider a different alternator if one could be had. </p>

<p>If you were really pounding the system, a possible candidate would be the
Optima Yellow top Starting battery (NOT the Yellow top Deep Cycle!) These are
supposed to better handle this sort of situation and recover faster when the
alternator spins up. Read about them at the links in the battery article.</p>

<h2>Will a CS alternator cure a power shortage?</h2>

<p>Maybe or maybe not, but it gives you options the SI family can't in a
package that is more reliable. It also depends what alternator you've got now.
If you were repeatedly frying SI's or need something bigger then I'd seriously
look into the CS 130 conversion instead of a bigger SI. There are limits on
alternator output even in the aftermarket. If you've overloaded the car with
aftermarket stuff then no alternator/battery combination may be big enough to
stay alive long in slow traffic.</p>

<p>Compared to the 94-amp 12-SI, even though the 105 amp CS-130 has similar
current available at idle, the CS is an all around better alternator than the
12-SI series. <span style="font-style:italic;">More importantly,</span> the higher peak current of the CS-130
means that even when it's running below maximum, it's making more power than
the 12-SI. For comparison, engine at idle, 2000 ARPM the 94 amp SI makes 50 amps and the
105-amp CS-130 makes about 70 amps.If you have
one of the smaller 10-SI or 12-SI then the 105-amp CS-130 is going to blow the
doors off it.</p>
<h3>Charts</h3>
<p>Look at 2000 RPM vs. Output Amps. 2000 is close to Pulley Ratio (Most are 2.5:1 - 2.6:1) x 900 Engine RPM.
(I never found cs130 chart. cs130d is close for this example...)</p>
<img src="csalt2/12si.jpg" height="325px" width="450" title="12SI Output vs ARPM" alt="12SI Output vs ARPM" align="left">
<img src="csalt2/cs130d.jpg" height="325px" width="450" title="CS130D Output vs ARPM" alt="CS130D Output vs ARPM">

<p>The CS units have an internal fan in addition to the external one. That
means better cooling in the hot Fiero engine bay. Keep in mind that even if the
heat doesn't kill the alternator outright, it will degrade performance and
reduce available power. So when hot, the 12-SI may not be able to make even the
paltry amperage it's rated for at low RPM. (This is why I said test when things
are hot at the beginning.)</p>

<p>If the V6 engine has clearance for it, you can run the &quot;iceberg&quot;
shell on the CS130 for even more cooling. If you can fit the Iceberg shell, you
can also run the 140 amp CS130's available in the aftermarket.</p>

<p>On a side note: The change to the CS130 for 88 V6 is part of why GM felt
safe deleting the expensive aux fan. The stupid aux fan wasn't running full
time anyway while the CS has 2 full time fans built in. Plus the second built in
fan cools without sucking amps. Even when an older Fiero is converted to CS,
leave the aux fan operational. It will still cool the ignition coil and further
cool the alternator when it runs.</p>

<h2>Could we spin the alternator faster for more power?</h2>

<p>Yes, and there are places where you can get smaller pulleys for the SI and
CS alternators to make them spin faster. BUT! This has to be done carefully or
you can over rev the alternator and blow it up at highway speeds. This option
is really only for slow moving vehicles like farm equipment or delivery people
in a big city. It won't help most people.</p>

<p>Selecting an alternator pulley is a little tricky. Alternators have a
mechanical limit on how fast you can spin them. Factory pulleys are selected to
allow decent current output during most driving without exceeding mechanical
limits when the car is floored.</p>

<p>I've been unable to find the original ARPM specs for the SI and CS
alternators. One unofficial number I found for a CS130 was 15000 ARPM. They
didn't say if that was continuous or peak. It wouldn't surprise me if it were
peak when you figure most stock engines rarely spin faster than 4000-5000 RPM.
Most cruising is between 2000 and 3000 RPM meaning the SI and CS only need to
survive 7000-10000 ARPM continuously. (For simplicity I've kept everything at
2:1 for this article but in the real world the alt may spin a little faster or
slower that 2x crank RPM depending on the vehicle.)</p>

<h2>Ok, Tell me more about under driving...</h2>

<p>Most people think that slowing down belt driven items adds HP. It doesn't
actually add anything. Under driving is primarily an attempt to reduce waste.
It's a little tricky to do right. Messing this up can hurt performance and may
even cause damage.</p>

<p>You can easily amplify or cause a power shortage by installing under drive,
AKA &quot;Power,&quot; pulleys. If you slow down the alternator you also reduce
it's output under most driving conditions. If the existing alternator is barely
keeping up, slowing it down won't help anything. You can also create cooling
system problems. The water pump needs to spin at a certain speed to keep the
engine cool. Just how much problem you may create depends on exactly how much
you under drive vs. how much power and water the car needs.</p>

<p>There are some places where slowing things down is good or even required.
Keep these in mind... Once the alternator reaches peak power output, spinning
it faster just wastes gas and HP. Spinning the Water Pump too fast can slow or
even stop water flow thru the engine. (The water pump is just whipping foam at
that point.) Mechanically, the Alternator, and the Water Pump, can croak
quickly above certain shaft speeds.</p>

<p>Here are two of the most common examples...</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0pt" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">If
     you have an engine capable of turning 6000 - 7000 RPM then the alternator
     will spin 12000-14000 ARPM or more with stock pulleys. If the motor spins
     even faster, easy in many drag motors, you'd have no choice but to slow
     the alternator to prevent burning it up.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">If
     you have a circle track car where the engine constantly spins 4000-5000
     RPM or more, you could run an alternator at 1:1 with the crank or even
     slower. The objective here is to keep the alternator at or below the ARPM
     where it produces peak power. Spinning any faster just wastes power.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another common trick for a race setup where many options have been ripped
out... Install a smaller alternator. A CS-121 for example could give you a
decrease in rotating and total mass vs. a CS-130 or CS-144. There are some very
small alternators available in the aftermarket.</p>

<h3>A Fiero Specific example...</h3>

<p>In Fiero, the V6 is commonly under driven using a pulley from someone like
Fiero Store. This isn't to bash a product, just to give you an idea how large
an effect a seemingly small number can make. </p>

<h4>How much alternator speed is lost?</h4>

<p>The Fiero Store pulley claims a 24% under drive. That means when the
alternator was spinning at 3000 ARPM... The new speed is 3000 ARPM - 720 ARPM
(24%) = 2280 ARPM. That is a pretty significant drop in ARPM. If you are
running the CS-130, where you were making 80 amps, now you're making around 60
amps. </p>

<p>Near Idle the situation is dismal. Keep in mind that most alternators don't
even light until 1000 ARPM. If you idle at 1600 ARPM then... 1600 - 384 (24%) =
1216 ARPM. When you were at 2000 ARPM, now it will run 1520. This means near
Idle you will be lucky to get even minimum amps from the alternator. You better
have a really good battery or you won't last long in heavy traffic with big
electrical loads. </p>

<h4>When will the alternator reach peak?</h4>

<p>To keep round numbers we'll use 5000 ARPM; GM spec peak is actually 6500
ARPM. This will at least give you the general idea. For fun, we'll run the
numbers compared to both a 2:1 and a 2.5:1 OE pulley setup. (Exact size doesn't
matter for this example.)</p>

<p>At 5000 APRM with 2:1 pulleys the engine was running 2500 RPM. If you apply
the 24% to the pulley ratio, the FS setup has 1.52:1 pulleys, 2500 Crank RPM x
1.52 = 3800 ARPM. You won't hit 5000 ARPM until the engine cranks nearly 3300
RPM. In other words the alternator will almost never reach peak output in normal
driving. You'll be lucky to get 50-60% of peak output most of the time.</p>

<p>To stay consistent with the rest of the article we have been assuming 2:1
for OE pulleys but say for giggles they are 2.5:1. That means an engine at 2500
RPM would spin the alternator 6250. A 24% pulley drop gives us 1.9:1 or 4750
ARPM. In this case you slowed the alternator but you get allot closer to
reaching peak output at normal RPM. In this case you'd see 5000 ARPM at 2630 on
the crank. You could still have trouble near idle.</p>

<h4>The Verdict</h4>

<p>As bad as this may sound, not everyone will have a problem under driving an
alternator. It all depends on the exact pulleys involved, what alternator is in
the car, how/where the car is driven and how big an electrical load is on the
system. </p>

<p>You've also got to be certain the cooling system is in excellent working
order. If you have an iffy cooling system slowing down the coolant flow could
make minor problems worse.</p>

<p>Will you make more power to the wheels? Maybe, but if you don't have enough
electrical power you'll defiantly have other problems. Low power can screw up
operation of the ECM, Ignition, and all sorts of other things. Before you
install one of these things make certain you aren't tight on power. If you have
to deal with allot of slow traffic I would not recommend the use of a power
pulley, especially in a car with AC and other high amp loads.</p>

<p>Side note: I think the FS pulley also slows the AC compressor. This could
cut AC performance. Just how much that matters will probably depend on where
you live.</p>

<h2>Capacitance</h2>

<p>In a normal car, the battery provides plenty of power to handle spikes from
switching accessories on and off but there is an application that causes major
problems for charging systems. The use of high power audio equipment can drive
the car completely nuts. The worst problems are high wattage bass and sub bass
amplifiers.</p>

<p>The load from a big audio system can quickly drain and even damage the
charging system. Every time the bass thumps your ears, it thumps the charging
system as well. The constant beating can also cause ECM/PCM errors and other
performance problems with the car. To reduce these problems, many audio shops
will install one or more large &quot;Electrolytic capacitors.&quot;</p>

<p>For our purposes, Capacitors work similar to the battery but they can
respond to load spikes much faster. (This article is long
enough without the details.) They are a valid solution to the problems caused
by audio systems. What the audio guys fail to tell people is that capacitors
are dangerous, especially when poorly made or installed. (I doubt many audio
shops even know any of this.)</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0pt" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">If a
     capacitor shorts internally, it can rapidly overheat and rupture. They should
     be mounted away from vehicle occupants. (Most all capacitors for this use
     are oil filled.)</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Capacitors
     aren't fond of being smacked around. They can take the vibration in most
     vehicles but they need to be protected from things that can impact the
     case. Case impact could create the previous internal short.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">If
     circuits with large capacitors are shorted, very high currents will pass
     thru the wiring. Potentially hundreds of amps can be dumped from large
     capacitor banks. This can cause fires.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">When
     performing any electrical work where you would normally disconnect the
     battery, you must also make sure the capacitors are disconnected and/or
     discharged. Large capacitors can keep power flowing for quite some time
     depending on the load.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Reconnecting
     the capacitors to the charging system can generate a large current spike.
     (Big spark when hooking up the battery.)</li>
</ul>

<p>As long as you install them carefully and treat them well, capacitors
shouldn't give you any problems. </p>

<ul style="margin-top:0pt" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Use
     good wiring and hardware when hooking them up and mounting them.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Use
     crimp terminals! Don't just try to clamp the wire under the terminal
     screws. Ring style crimps are best. Those won't fall off if the screw
     comes loose.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Make
     sure nothing can short the terminals. </li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Mount
     them someplace where they will stay cool. (If you wouldn't store spray
     cans in that spot then it's no good for capacitors either.)</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">If
     you need more than one or two, use a circuit board instead of a bunch of
     wire to connect them. You can get these from many audio stores.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Use
     good capacitors! These are very often a &quot;you get what you pay
     for&quot; item.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Make
     sure the capacitors are made for this use. Most audio stores will have the
     right ones but others may not.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Electrolytic
     capacitors are polarized. If you hook them up wrong, you ruin them. </li>
</ul>

<p>Hooking up one or two capacitors is fairly easy. If you are
building/installing banks of capacitors get help from someone and make sure you
won't set the car on fire if there is a problem.</p>
