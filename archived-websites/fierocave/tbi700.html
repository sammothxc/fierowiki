<h1>700 Series TBI</h1>
<p class="warn">Warning: Check the fuel regulator for leaks!</p>

<p>700 series is very reliable but the fuel regulator diaphragm does wear out
causing fuel leak. When you have leakage then get the rebuild kit. (Standard
Motor, Part # 1637B and others.) Kit comes with the diaphragm and all gaskets etc.</p>
<p>Do not remove the cover, retighten screws, or any thing else until you have
a new diaphragm.</p>
<h2>History &amp; Important Parts</h2>
<p>The TBI used for 87-88 Fiero 4 cylinder motors is the 700 series unit
presently manufactured by Delphi Automotive for GM. </p>

<p>You can find Delphi's public relations info for the 700 TBI here. 
(The products have been discontinued.)
The information includes images and
general specification data. Read <a href="https://fierowiki.samwarr.dev/api/public/dl/EvpPN0OJ/docs/fierocave-docs/TBISingle.pdf">&quot;Throttle Bodies - Single Point&quot;</a> 
and <a href="https://fierowiki.samwarr.dev/api/public/dl/EvpPN0OJ/docs/fierocave-docs/TBIBottom Feed.pdf">&quot;Throttle Bodies - Multec Bottom Feed.&quot;</a> The first is
the TBI unit and the second is the injector in more detail. Fiero uses the
low-pressure version. </p>

<p>See also: <a href="tbi700-2.htm">TBI 700 Exploded</a></p>

<p>Below you can see how the TBI is setup and where some of it's components are. 
I also noted the MAT sensor for you. (MAT is also covered in the DIS article.)</p>

<p><img align="right" border="0" src="tbi700/700a1.jpg" alt="700 TBI layout"></p>
<ul>
<li>FPR, Fuel Pressure Regulator</li>
<li>TPS, Throttle Position Sensor</li>
<li>IAC, Idle Air Control motor</li>
<li>F In/Out, Fuel Lines
<li>MAT, Manifold Air Temperature</li>
</ul>

<p>The design of this TBI is really something. It can tolerate amazing amounts of crap
in the fuel system without plugging the injector. There are screens right on
the injector. You'd have to cover them nearly completely to block off injector
flow. To get that much trash to the TBI, both the main filter and the pickup
sock in the tank would have to fail or you'd have to have major corrosion
damage to the inside of the fuel lines.</p>

<p>The 700 TBI is comprised of two modules. The upper section handles all the fuel
metering and is the same regardless of what lower section is used. The lower
section handles all the air metering and contains the throttle plate and IAC. There
is no fuel flow between the modules except what flows from the injector tip. 700
TBI bore diameter is determined entirely in the lower section. (If you were
punching out a 700, you would only machine the lower half. The lower section, assuming
there is enough metal, can be punched to the maximum diameter of the upper
half.)</p>

<p>BTW, the
TBI used for 87 and 88 Fiero L4 has a 45mm diameter main bore. The largest
Delphi makes is 48mm. You could install a 48mm one but you'll need to ream the
manifold and you probably won't gain much power.</p>

<h2>Do I need to use injector cleaner in my gas?</h2>

<p>Probably
not. The cleaners already present in most pump gas should be more than enough.
Keep in mind that this injector is not being heat soaked like port injectors
are after engine shutdown. It's far from the intake valves and upstream of the
throttle as well. That prevents fuel residue from cooking onto the injector.</p>

<p>The only
time I can think of where cleaner might help is if the car sat parked for a
long time. That should help wash away anything caused by stale fuel.</p>

<p>With this
system, if you are finding allot of carbon in the TBI and intake then you have
problems developing that need more than some cleaner. (You will likely also
need to check/replace the MAT sensor.)</p>

<h2>Throttle Position Sensor</h2>

<p>The TPS
is not adjustable. The ECM is programmed to accept any slight variation in the
home position of the sensor and recalibrates the home position each time the
engine is started.</p>

<p>The TPS
does wear over time, but it should last many years under most conditions.</p>

<p>Do not
attempt to clean the sensor and never spray it with solvents or pressure
washers.</p>

<p>The
easiest way to test the TPS is to use a sewing needle to probe the terminals.
It's long and very thin so you are less likely to cause a short if you slip.
Simply slip the needle between the wire and the seal. If you short the
terminals to anything you could fry the ECM! </p>

<p>One
terminal will show 5V. Another terminal is ground. The last is the output. The
TPS output should show less than 1.25 volt when the TBI is at idle. Output
voltage should increase smoothly between idle and WOT. (Note: It is usually
easier to test the sensor with an analog meter. Digital displays are often too
jittery.)</p>

<h2>The Injector</h2>

<p>Note: Don't rely on the visual appearance of the injector output. In most
cases you won't be able to tell a good spray amount/pattern by eye. These
systems nearly always look like shower heads when running. Keep in mind that
unlike port fuel injection, fuel from the TBI has plenty of time to mix on the
way to the cylinders. The TBI is also on a heated manifold just like a
carburetor uses.</p>

<p>If the injector is leaking it will tend to do that as soon as the system
pressurizes. The most common leak is O-ring failure but it is possible for the
injector to leak internally.</p>

<p>The injector used in these is built like a tank. I don't think I've heard of
more than one or two that was actually bad. I'd say 99% of the time if the
injector weren't firing that you need to check the fuel pressure and the signal
from the ECM.</p>

<p>If the injector is leaking, make sure it's not one of the two O rings. The O
rings are more likely to fail than the injector. If the O rings are bad, then
I'd rebuild the TBI and replace all the other stuff as well. </p>

<p>There are test (&quot;noid&quot;) lights for the injector used in the 700. Use them! A
single noid light costs around $6 while the injector costs $75 to $100 or more.
You can get noid lights at many parts stores. You can get whole sets of them
online from various sources. </p>

<h2>Idle Air Control motor</h2>

<p>Contrary to popular belief the IAC is very well designed and will last
nearly forever under most conditions. If you think there is an IAC problem your
first project should be checking for vacuum leaks and EGR problems.</p>

<p>DO NOT spray the IAC with &quot;carb&quot; cleaner. If you must try to clean it, use
electronics parts cleaner. Strong solvents can eat the insulation off the
coils.</p>

<p>You can now get test (&quot;noid&quot;) lights for IAC as well as the injector. I've
seen these for about $10 at Pep Boys.</p>

<p>Ideally, you'll use an IAC noid with an ECM scanner. The lights on the noid
should match whatever the scanner says the ECM is doing. The quickest test is
to plug in the noid light and create a small vacuum leak or turn on the AC. (If
the AC works...) Either one should cause the ECM to try to adjust the IAC. Even
simply moving the throttle some should create an IAC change.</p>
<h3>When does the IAC reset?</h3>
<p>Per GM service documents:<p>
<p class="quote">The IAC valve will be reset by the computer when the vehicle speed exceeds 43
        MPH while the engine speed is above 2000 RPM. <br>Or<br> When the diagnostic test
        connector is grounded when the engine RPM is above 2000 RPM.</p>

<h2>Fuel Pressure Regulator</h2>

<p>The fuel pressure regulator is very unlikely to fail. If/when it does, it
usually leaks externally. It could be possible for something to get trapped in
the regulator and hold it open. Corrosion of the regulator valve and seat are
unlikely. They appear to be Stainless Steel. Keep in mind that if you remove
the regulator that it may not seal reliably when you put it back on. Do NOT use
gasket sealer on it! If it leaks then it needs to be replaced.</p>

<p>The fuel pump on the other hand is a common failure item, especially if
you've run the tank dry. The fuel flow cools the pump and it won't take long to
cook when running dry. (This is true of the many kinds of pumps, not just fuel
pumps.)</p>

<p>The quick test for no or low pressure is to pinch the fuel return line and
see if you get pressure. This may help if the regulator is blocked open but
probably won't do a thing if the pump is batty.</p>

<p>There is a fuel pressure gauge set available for TBI and other low-pressure
systems that don't have Schrader valves. The set includes and adapter that save
you from cutting the line to install a T. These sets are expensive, typically
over $50. You may be able to borrow one from some parts stores. (The expensive
part is the adaptor that installs between the fuel line and the TBI body so you
can connect the gauge.)</p>

<h2>Fuel Filter</h2>

<p>It's under the car and can be a real pain to change.</p>

<p>You want to change this every so often, like once a year or so. These
filters are built like a small oil filter internally and hold a tremendous
amount of garbage.</p>

<p>The only way I can think of that you could plug the thing are if the fuel
line is going bad or if the pickup sock in the tank fails. If you seem to loose
fuel pressure after the car runs for a while, the filter could be the problem.</p>

<p>If you are going to remove the filter for any reason then just replace it.
They don't cost very much and you can usually get them even cheaper at places
like Wal-Mart.</p>

<h2>Repair &amp; Rebuilding</h2>
<p class="note">NOTICE:
The throttle position sensor (TPS), idle air control (IAC) valve, pressure
regulator diaphragm assembly, fuel injector or other components containing
rubber, SHOULD NOT be placed in a solvent or cleaner bath. 
(No spray can Carburetor, EFI cleaner, or other strong solvent on electric parts.) 
A chemical reaction
will cause these parts to swell, harden or distort. Do not soak the throttle
body with the above parts attached. If the throttle body requires cleaning,
soaking time in the cleaner should be kept to a minimum. Some models have
hidden throttle shaft dust seals that could lose their effectiveness by
extended soaking. (Source: 88 Fiero Service Manual)</p>


<p class="warn">When installing the IAC motor, make sure the pintle is retracted.
DO NOT force the IAC motor into the throttle body! If the IAC motor will not
easily seat fully in the body then the pintle is too far out. You should be
able to seat the motor fully into the throttle body with little effort.</p>

<p>Carefully check the TBI mounting holes in the manifold. These holes can be
damaged if the air cleaner has impacted the trunk wall. (Read the torque strut
article.) If the holes are stripped you'll have to use Helicoils on them.</p>

<p>If the throttle shaft is badly worn, find another TBI unit. You should be
able to find these fairly easily at any salvage yard. Otherwise the 700 unit is
very easy to rebuild.</p>

<p>Don't mess with the idle stop during rebuild! There's no reason to fool with
it.</p>

<p>The rebuild kits include the fuel pressure regulator diaphragm. If the FPR
diaphragm is bad then just buy the rebuild kit and be done with it. The kit
isn't that much more than buying the diaphragm and you get all the gaskets, O
rings, and screens. You essentially end up with a new TBI unit.</p>

<p>The rebuild kit usually comes with more gaskets than you will use. The last
one I bought came with three mounting gaskets and two body gaskets. You should
use the replacement gasket that matches the original.</p>

<h3>Assembling and Mounting the TBI</h3>

<p>When you put the two halves of the body together torque the screws to
specification.</p>

<p>After you torque the mounting bolts, check the body screws again and torque
as needed to reach specification. The mounting bolts often cause the body bolts
to loosen. If you don't check them the upper body could warp and cause an air
leak.</p>

Here's how the vacuum lines connect to the 700.

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>The 700 TBI is not covered in the Haynes Fiero book. Haynes does cover the
700 in their 86-96 Fuel Injection book. (Haynes # 10220) This book covers both
versions of TBI used in Fiero. Amazon lists the book as out of print but it can
still be found in many part store inventories.</p>

<p>The only other book I know of that documents this unit is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181122/http://www.helminc.com/" target="_blank">Helm</a> shop book. While expensive, these books
cover all the year specific items left out of Haynes and Chilton. They also
carry replacement Owners Manuals and other info.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181122/http://www.alldata.com/products/diy/index.html" target="_blank">ALLDATA DIY</a> is
a good source. This is the online version of the CD/DVD product they are well
known for. While you can work directly from their data, I usually consider them
a supplement to other sources, including the Helm book. ALLDATA has all the TSB
and Shop Manual updates you just can't get anywhere else. If the online version
allows printing, I'd say join them for a year and print everything you can get
your hands on. (I strongly recommend a laser printer over an ink jet. Most ink
jets are likely to eat multiple cartridges doing this.)</p>

<h3>Adjustment Procedures</h3>

<p>The only
adjustment possible on the 700 is to the idle stop screw. With the possible
exception of new replacement units, there is no reason I can think of that you
should ever adjust the idle stop. All the ones used on 2.5 liter motors should
transplant without changing the idle stop.</p>

<p>The only
reason I'm covering the idle stop adjustment is because every so often you run
into a motor where some hack has screwed it up. You'll know if that's happened
because the Idle Stop seal will have been removed.</p>

<h3>Idle Stop</h3>
<p class="warn">Warning: Do not use a ECM Scan tool to make this adjustment! 
ECM scanner mess with timing and gives you higher RPM.</p>

<p>Short version...</p>

<ol style="margin-top:0pt" start="1" type="1">
 <li>Plug any vacuum port, as required.</li>
 <li>Jumper ALDL terminals A &amp; B.</li>
 <li>Turn on key, <b>engine off</b>, and wait 45 seconds. This will close IAC pintle.</li>
 <li>Unplug IAC <b>while key is still on.</b></li>
 <li>Turn key off and remove the ALDL jumper.</li>
 <li>Start car and set Idle Stop screw for 600 +/-50 RPM. (550 - 650 RPM is fine.)</li>
 <li>Shut off the car and plug the IAC in. </li>
 <li>Replug any vacuum ports.</li>
</ol>

<p>Source: 1988 Fiero Service Manual, page 6E2-C2-12 thru 13. </p>
<p>Notes:<br>
Use a good tachometer, not the dash tach. It is easer and more accurate.<br>
Once you are done, clear any errors that may have been set in the ECM. </p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>This section is mainly a bunch of pondering. I'm still looking into most of
it. I thought I'd put in what I had in case it's useful to someone who wants a
bit more power from the DIS motor. (It could also be useful to someone
replacing a fried DIS motor...)</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, the Fiero TBI has the 45mm main bore. You might be
able to find a 48mm unit to install. How much power you'd gain from that I
couldn't say but it's something to keep in the back of you head if you are
building up a DIS motor. It may be possible to bore out a TBI unit but I
wouldn't hold me breath on it. It's not something you can do without a good
machine shop.</p>

<p>If you do go looking for a 48mm unit, check the intake manifolds and head of
later model DIS L4 as well. This could save modification of the stock manifold
and may give you larger intake runners etc.</p>

<p>The reason I say this is that GM specified the 91 Olds Cutlass Calais (VIN
U?) Iron Duke at 112HP. I've seen that motor once and only externally. It
looked identical to the 1988 engine. (Balancer motor.) They had to ring out the
extra from someplace.</p>

<p>In reality, you'd be better off seeing if the 1991 engine would work in
Fiero and then building that up if needed. That gives you an engine 5-6 years
newer as a base. I couldn't see why it would not but I haven't been able to
really dig into one yet. You should be able to get one for about $200-300 from
a local salvage yard. (I believe 1991 was the last year for this engine.)</p>

<p>If you do that, make sure you also get its ECM! The PROM chip has
information in it that may be needed. I'm pretty sure the thing still uses the
same ECM as Fiero. Assuming the ECMs are the same, the VSS flag in the PROM
isn't. You'll have to trick the ECM or burn a new PROM with the correct VSS
flag. (You could just use the Fiero PROM but you'd loose updated code in the 91
PROM. The original Fiero PROMS have a few minor issues...)</p>

<h3>Fuel Pressure</h3>

<p>According to what I'm told, you can make the fuel pressure regulator
adjustable. If you try this, do it to a spare regulator cover. It involves
cleaning out the sealer/solder over the regulator screw. You may also need a
longer screw and a jam nut to prevent the pressure from changing due to
vibration. (Someone in the forum did this once. I forget who...)</p>

<p>To tune it, you'll need a fuel pressure gauge and a chassis dyno or a Gtech
unit. You really don't want to do this by feel alone.</p>

<p>The idea is to start from OE pressure and tweak the thing up a little bit at
a time until performance peaks. (It's a bit more involved than I'm covering
here.)</p>

<p>Note that too high/low pressure could cause DTC 45 or 44 set by ECM.
Keep in mind that if you restrict fuel flow too much you could burn out the
fuel pump!</p>
