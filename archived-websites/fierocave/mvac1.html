<h1>Climate Control</h1>

<p>Assorted notes for fixing interior climate control components.</p>

<h2>System performance</h2>

<p>To get the most heating or cooling performance from the climate control
system, avoid running the blower on high speed. You'll get more heat from the
system sooner because the lower speeds give the air more time to pass thru the
system. Same thing works for AC. On high the blower moves the air so fast that
it spends very little time in contact with the heater or evaporator.</p>

<p>If you're having trouble getting heat from the system and everything in the
cooling system seems ok, the heater core may be air locked. Try bleeding the
heater core as described in the cooling system article.</p>

<p>Beyond that the heater core may be full of either internal or external
trash. </p>

<ul style="margin-top:0pt" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Leaves
     and other junk may have built up in the heater box. This can be very
     dangerous. If this garbage gets against the blower speed resistor, it's
     been known to catch on fire. (Several forum members have had this happen!)</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Internal
     trash is most often the result of failing to maintain the coolant. If
     flushing won't clean things out then it's usually easier to replace the
     core instead of trying to get it cleaned or repaired.</li>
</ul>

<p>(I'm not covering AC performance here. There are too many things to go wrong
with that system.) </p>

<h2>AC/Heat Mode Actuators</h2>

<p>The Fiero is somewhat unique in it's use of a Servo Motor system to operate
the dampers in the AC/Heating unit in the passenger compartment instead of more
traditional vacuum motors. These electric devices are controlled by a set of
push buttons mounted above the radio. </p>

<p>Servicing the actuators is straightforward. Either it works or it doesn't.
If it fails to stop at a particular position, it could be a control switch, or
the actuator. Generally though an actuator will fail either by the motor
spinning with no resulting change to the dampers, or it won't spin at all. </p>

<h3>Which motor does what?</h3>

<p>The actuator behind the radio is the busy one. That one controls flow to all
the system's outlets. 
The one that is buried under the system is used only when
the AC is set to Max. It opens the recirculation door. Of the two, the one
behind the radio is the most likely to have a problem.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>You did check the fuses.....</p>

<p>There are three ways to test for problems in the electric duct control
system. The easy one is to swap a known good set of controls but this is
difficult to impossible for many people... So what else can be done?</p>

<h4>Option 1</h4>

<p>If you have an extra control set, just plug in the control board to test the
motors. </p>

<p>If you are borrowing the controls from another car, just move the board with
the buttons. To get the board loose, remove the aluminum cover then remove the
three screws that hold the board. (One thru the board and two thru the metal
bar for the buttons. Sometimes they aren't all there... Don't worry about
that.)</p>

<p>Just using the board will save you from having to mess with the temperature
slide(s). </p>

<h4>Option 2</h4>

<p>This test will assume all the wiring is ok. No one is likely to screw with
the motor wiring but anything is possible.</p>

<p>For this one, you need to pull out the control head and disconnect the large
connector from the control board. (Leave everything else hanging out of the
way.) </p>

<p>The table above shows what terminals in the control connector you will need
to test each motor.</p>

<p>Connect a FUSED 12V source to the terminals above (One at a time) and see if
the motor stops at the correct position. If the motor doesn't turn or fails to
stop then the motor is bad. If the motor does work and stop at the right spot
then the control board is bad.</p>

<p>The 12V source should be fused for 1-2 amps. The motors only draw about 150
milliamps.</p>

<h4>Option 3</h4>

<p>This one can be used to test a mounted motor or a loose one. If you are
testing a loose motor, be careful the arm doesn't pinch you. That arm has more
torque than you might think. The table below lists the terminals on the motors.</p>

<p>Terminal A on the Mode motor is the one farthest from the corner of the
case. I think the Recirc motor is the same but I've not seen them. They are so
hard to get at I can't test the one in my car.</p>

<p>Ground the A terminal and connect a FUSED 12V source to the other terminals
one at a time. The motor will run for a bit then stop at the correct position.
If the motor doesn't turn or fails to stop then the motor is bad. (If you are
testing a loose motor, just make sure it stops at the same spot each time you
power a particular terminal.)</p>

<p>Again, the 12V source should be fused for 1-2 amps. The motors only draw
about 150 milliamps.</p>

<h3>Service</h3>

<p>I've never had the motors themselves apart. Haven't run into a dead one yet... It may
be possible to fix one but don't hold your breath over it. </p>

<p>The Actuators are a real pain to get at. One is located behind the radio and
has 2 linkages inside the duct. The other is under the ductwork with the crank
facing the driver's side. This one is very uncomfortable to reach. </p>

<p>To remove Actuator behind the radio, unplug the control cable, and then
remove the two hex head screws. After the screws are out, Carefully lift the
Actuator away from the heater box until you take up the slack. Find some small
locking pliers, forceps, or even string and hold onto the linkages. If you drop
the damper links they will be an absolute shit to get a hold of again later!
Continue to support the actuator while you do this! </p>

<p>There is a flat steel spring clip on the end of the actuator crank pin. With
a pair of forceps, or needle nose pliers, rotate the clip so you can pull it
off then CAREFULLY pull it off. Forceps, and locking pliers, are preferred for
this since they will lock and hold the clip securely. DO NOT lose this clip!
You might need it later if you didn't get one with a new unit or dropped the
clip when harvesting the used unit you are installing. </p>

<p>The tricky part is getting the links back onto the replacement actuator. If
you dropped the links then good luck to you, if you locked onto them like I
just told you to, then you're made. Put the links back onto the crack in the
order they came off! The links will only fit one way on the Mode motor's crank! </p>

<p>The actuator under the duct can be reached, with great difficulty, by
crawling under the dash on the driver's side. This one only has one linkage.
The clip and link are easy to deal with. I'm not sure how it's screwed to the
duct. There is a small metal bracket. I can't see if you take the motor off the
bracket or if you take the bracket off the duct. Neither one will be easy.</p>

<h2>Temperature control</h2>

<p>The temperature control slide uses a push/pull cable. This cable attaches to
an arm on the top of the duct below the left speaker. This rarely goes bad. If
it doesn't work most of the time you've snapped the pin on the slider or gotten
something hung up on the cable or in the heater box.</p>

<h2>Fan Speed Control Knob</h2>

<p>Warning! The heater blower switch knob is held in place by a small &quot;rolled
leaf&quot; spring. Be careful taking the knob off, as this spring is sometimes loose
and can fall out of the knob. If you lose it the knob won't stay on the shaft
without adhesive. If you must glue it on I suggest you use silicone as it can
later be removed if need be to service the switch, or replace the knob. </p>

<h2>The button fell off...</h2>

<p>The buttons on the AC/Heater controls are not actually attached to the switch
stems. Two little ears on each button are the only things that keep them from
falling out of the controls. Sometimes the ears break off the button and then
the button either pops out more than the others or pops out entirely.</p>

<p>The easiest fix is to put a little RTV silicone inside the button and slide
it back on the stem. If the button hasn't come out completely you'll need to
pull the control set to get to the back of the button. Make sure the button
lines up with the others and then leave it alone until the Silicone sets.</p>

<p>I recommend RTV silicone for this just in case you ever need to take the
things apart for some odd reason. If you use another glue, use something that
sets slowly so you have time to line up the buttons. Don't use super glue!</p>


<h2>Heater Core</h2>

<p>The heater core on cars with AC is replaced according to the instructions in
the Haynes book but removing the cover can be a bit tricky. Here are a couple
things that make the cover easier to deal with. (This might apply to non-AC
cars but I've never seen one.)</p>

<p>Take the Chime socket off its bracket. The ones that face right are held by
2 screws. The ones that face down are held by one screw and the other side is
sort of wedged onto an ear on the bracket. Let the whole thing hang by the
wires.</p>

<p>The top screw is hidden under some insulation. Take out the speaker and
slide your hand forward along the top of the cover joint until you feel the
boss. The other three screws are pretty easy to find. There's only one screw on
each side of the cover.</p>

<p>If you loose a screw and can't find a replacement then leave the top hole
empty. The other three hold a spring against the heater core and help seal a
gasket in the bottom of the cover. (The gasket is supposed to help contain
leaks in the core. It doesn't always work.)</p>
