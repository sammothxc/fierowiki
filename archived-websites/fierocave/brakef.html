<h1>Drip Drip Drip</h1>
<p>I've given brake fluid it's own page since the information applies
to both stock and upgraded systems. This subject is just to complex to
be buried in with other stuff.</p>
<h2>Why Change Fluid? I thought it was permanent.</h2>
<p>Actually, many people think brake fluid is a permanent part of the
car. Since this fluid rarely appears in maintenance schedules, many
service people think that to. The rated service life of most brake
fluid products is 2-3 years but like antifreeze, the stuff may not be
changed for the life of the car. The average car will only get enough
new fluid to make up for bleeding during repair work.</p>
<p>Another reason for confusion is that GM and some others claim the
factory-installed fluid is good for years. They say it has better
additives etc and doesn't need changing often if at all. Problem here
is the "factory" fluid likely will not be used during brake service.
Once a third party fluid is installed, the system drops to the service
life of the new fluid. (I have my doubts about how well these factory
fluids hold up against wet environments. I'd treat them the same as any
other fluid in race or off road applications.) I certainly would
replace the fluid in all Fiero at this point. Even long life stuff
isn't going to be any good by now.</p>
<p>Brake fluid, like it's distant cousin antifreeze, contains
lubricants and corrosion inhibitors that degrade over time. The failure
of these additives is a very large cause of brake component failure.
Moisture absorption is another issue and we'll cover it in more detail
later. Moisture will lower the boiling point of the fluid, and in fluid
with dead inhibitors, accelerate corrosion of the system. We defiantly
want to get the water out.</p>
<p>Changing fluid also removes suspended trash generated by wear of
system components. These particles are often abrasive. Even with a
"long life" factory fill we want to periodically remove the trash.
Dirty fluid is just as bad as fluid with dead additives or too much
moisture. This is even more important with ABS systems that often have
many small parts moving rapidly under extremely high pressure. It
doesn't take allot of trash to screw up an ABS pump. (If you think rear
calipers are expensive, price ABS units sometime....)</p>
<h2>What Fluid do we use?</h2>
<p>The Fiero is built to use DOT 3 fluid. Unless you are totally
rebuilding the system, anything else you might consider must be
compatible with this fluid. </p>
<p>At the very least, you want to run one of the "heavy duty" DOT 3
formulas. Other fluids are also compatible and increase both wet and
dry boiling protection along with having improved wear and corrosion
inhibitors.</p>
<p>So our short answer is... Use the DOT 3 compatible fluid with the
highest wet and dry boiling temperatures you can find. </p>
<p>Notice I said to watch both <span style="font-style:italic;">wet</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">dry</span> boil in the
short answer. Not all fluid labeled "heavy duty" or "high temperature"
is the same. Some of these products, like STP Heavy Duty DOT 3 claim a
500&deg;F Dry boil but still carry 284&deg;F wet boil. Since no brake system is
ever totally dry, that low temperature will be a factor. (Racing brake
fluids commonly have low wet boiling points. Many are so low they can
only be certified as DOT 3. Keep in mind, the makers of these fluids
expect you to change it often.) We'll get to more about the boiling
temperature in a little bit.</p>
<p>Before we can choose the best fluid, we have to understand a "few"
things.</p>
<h3>Mixing Fluid</h3>
<p>Many of the DOT 3 DOT 4 and DOT 5.1 fluids can be mixed in a system
but always check manufacturers information first. When you do mix them,
there is one rule that must be followed.</p>
<p class="warn">NEVER use fluid that is LESS than the original
specification for the car. In other words, Do Not put DOT 3 fluid in a
car built for DOT 4.<br>
</p>
<p>By law the required fluid type is printed on the tank lid of all
cars sold in the U.S.<br>
</p>
<h2>Just what is Brake Fluid?</h2>
<p>Unlike other hydraulic fluids, Brake fluid is a complicated mix of
chemicals. It contains no mineral or petroleum products. Federal Motor
Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) divide it into 2 main groups Silicone
Based or Non Silicone Based.</p>
<p>While the exact makeup of any fluid varies by maker, DOT 3, 4 and
5.1 are mainly composed of various Glycol compounds.</p>
<p>Here's an example DOT 3 fluid from DOW. (Nobody publishes the exact
formula.)</p>
<p class="quote">2. COMPOSITION/INFORMATION ON INGREDIENTS<br>
Polyethylene glycol butyl ether CAS# 009004-77-7 60 - 90%<br>
Piperazine CAS# 000110-85-0 0.1 - 1.0%<br>
Proprietary mixture of glycol ethers, polyglycols, glycols,oxidation
inhibitors and corrosion inhibitors 10 - 40%</p>
<p>Source: Material Safety Data Sheet for DOW BRAKE FLUID 1100</p>
<p>DOT 5 Silicone is defined in the FMVSS 571.116 specification.</p>
<p class="quote">S4. <span style="font-style:italic;">Definitions.</span></p>
<p class="quote">A <span style="font-style:italic;">silicone base brake fluid </span>(SBBF) is a brake
fluid, which consists of not less than 70 percent by weight of a
diorgano polysiloxane.</p>
<p class="note">Note! From here on, unless we are talking about a
specific DOT number, the fluids will be referred to mainly by their
base material. DOT 3, 4 and 5.1 are Glycol based fluids. (It's a
different Glycol from antifreeze.) DOT 5 fluid is Silicone based and is
totally different from Glycol fluids.<br>
</p>
<h2>Why is water such a big deal?</h2>
<p>In Gylcol fluid, the main issue is that water reduces the boiling
point. In Silicone fluid,
it can cause water slugs/puddles in low places in the system. Both of
these conditions can have disastrous results. (We'll cover Silicone in
more
detail later.)<br>
</p>
<h3>Glycol brake fluid is Hygroscopic and
Hydrophilic.&nbsp;<br>
</h3>
<p>Hygroscopic
means it will pull water from the air every second any part of the
system is open. It will pull water thru any microscopic opening large
enough to pass a
water molecule, including pores in the seal and hose materials
themselves. This
is why you always want
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NEW</span>
fluid from <span style="font-weight: bold;">Factory SEALED</span>
containers for brake work.<br>
</p>
<p>The
good thing is Glycol fluid is Hydrophilic, meaning is will absorb and
disperse
water thru the entire volume of fluid. This actually protects the
system and performance as long as you don't leave the stuff to get
soaked.<br>
</p>
<h3>How does water enter the brake system? It's a sealed system. Isn't
it?</h3>
<p>It might be more accurate to think of the system as having a bunch
of tightly controlled leaks. Because we have moving parts, we're always
going to have some fluid migration past seals.</p>
<p>Fluid migration and other factors combine to bring water into the
system. If there are any defects in the system, water absorption will
happen at an amazing rate. For example, leaving the reserve tank open
overnight will saturate Glycol fluid completely with moisture. You'll
need to flush the entire system before it's safe to drive the car.</p>
<p>A big culprit is the reserve tank cover. Make sure the cover gasket
is in good shape. If there is any question, get a new gasket. This
thing is so over looked yet so important. Any damage to this gasket is
reason to replace it. Even a tiny pinhole will allow the fluid to soak
in huge amounts of water in no time. (These gaskets can be found in
MotorMite's red HELP! packaging. They only cost a few dollars.)</p>
<p>Glycol fluid also leaves a film on moving parts. This is a good
thing for the parts since it provides lubrication but it's bad in that
the film helps draw water. Items like the MC and drum brake slave
cylinders have more of this film on them than disk brake calipers but
they all have it. As the parts move over the exposed film of fluid,
water is transferred into the system. </p>
<p>Driving down a flooded street or hitting a caliper with a pressure
washer can force water inside the caliper. (Especially if the outer
"dust" seal is damaged!) The water can sit in the dead space between
seals and work it's way around the piston seal(s) over time. Many brake
systems don't get hot enough, often enough, to quickly dry out this
water.</p>
<p>The slave cylinder in Drum brakes can easily let in water if the
axle is swamped. These cylinders use a cup seal. This type of seal can
work like a one way valve. It will hold very high brake pressure but
any liquid or gas trying to get in is probably going to. (This type of
seal is what makes the Step Bore MC work.)<br>
</p>
<h3>Myth: Using Racing brake hoses will stop water absobtion.</h3>
<p>Using alternate line stocks will not stop water absorbtion. While
the hoses may not pass moisture, the rest of the system's soft parts
will. There is
no way to stop moisture from being pulled into a Glycol fluid. At best
using alternate line stocks may slow total water absorbtion by the
system. You will still need to replace the fluid at regular intervals.<br>
</p>
<h2>DOT DOT DOT (Dash)</h2>
<p>Before you can compare different fluids, you need to know what the
DOT numbers mean. You also need to keep in mind that the DOT
specifications define minimum performance. Nearly all fluids will
exceed the performance for their labeled specification. </p>
<p>The DOT numbers describe much more than the boiling points of the
fluid in question. There are specifications for wear protection,
corrosion protection, viscosity, color, seal degradation, and a raft of
other stuff. In very basic terms you could say, the higher the DOT
number, the better the fluid. In reality, you have to look at each
fluid individually because there are vast differences from one product
to the next.</p>
<p>We can find all the needed standards information in the National
Archive's Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). [My comments are in square

<p>Notice that there is not much mention of DOT 5.1 in the actual
specification. That's because the 5 or 5.1 mainly define the fluid base
material. DOT 5 is always Silicone Based and DOT 5.1 has more in common
with DOT 3 and DOT 4. With a couple exceptions, both must meet the same
minimum standards to be DOT 5. We see this better in the labeling and
testing sections of the standard.</p>
<p class="quote">S5.2.2 <span style="font-style:italic;">Certification, marking, and labeling.</span></p>
<p class="quote">S5.2.2.1 Each manufacturer of a DOT grade brake fluid

<p class="quote">(a) A serial number identifying the production lot and

<h3>The Truth about Wet Boiling Point</h3>
<p>The minimum Wet boiling temperature specified in the FMVSS and
product literature is tested when brake fluid has about 3-4% water
content. (3.70, plus/minus 0.05, percent by weight.)</p>
<p>In real life, your fluid may have <span style="font-style:italic;">significantly more</span> than 3%
water in it. The older the fluid the higher the water content will be.
Even when in perfect running order, most vehicles will saturate to 3%
within a couple years. If a vehicle is frequently driven in wet
terrain, the fluid can saturate to 3% in a few months. Keep in mind,
most vehicles on the road today have <span style="font-style:italic;">never</span> had the brake fluid
changed. </p>
<p>More water equals lower boiling point. The boiling point <span style="font-style:italic;">can and
will</span> drop below the product's labeled specifications. This is why
you want fluid with a high Wet boil temperature. The higher the
specified Wet boiling point the longer the fluid will take to become
unsafe because of water saturation. </p>
<h3>So where does Valvoline SynPower Synthetic compare? You blab about
it often enough.</h3>
<p>I like this one because it's not super expensive and delivers
excellent performance. I use it in my own vehicles. I think you'd be
hard pressed to find better fluid for the money.</p>
<p class="note">Sadly, Valvoline discontinued SynPower brake fluid. New products are about same price and can be use in DOT3 or DOT4 systems. So don't bother with any fluid that meets DOT3 only. (3-Oct-11)
</p>

<h3>Other DOT 3 Compatible Fluids</h3>
<p>These are links to other fluids listed in various Forum threads and
other places. I have not used or tested any of these products. The
Published data says these are compatible with DOT 3. All street
applications should avoid "Race" fluid products with low Wet boiling
points.</p>

<h2>Why is everyone so hot for Silicone "DOT 5" fluid?</h2>
<p>I have no idea. People got the idea that if it works in racing it
must work for the street. This same problem has everyone thinking they
need to install better brake parts in everything. Another thing is that
many of the people who say the stuff works great are comparing it to
the crappy old fluid that was in the system before. If they put new
high temperature DOT 3 in, they would have had the same results.</p>
<p>Keep in mind Race applications are torn apart for service all the
time and they usually aren't driven in the rain. Road cars don't get
the fluid changed often if at all and are driven in rain all the time.
With very rare exceptions, the carmakers all use DOT 3 and DOT 4 even
in their high performance cars. There are very good reasons for this
and for a change, cost is one of the minor ones.</p>
<p>The main reason sited for using Silicone based DOT 5 brake fluid is
a need for higher boiling temperature. Many people falsely believe that
it is some sort of cure-all for the perceived problems associated with
Glycol based DOT 3 and DOT 4. The truth is that Silicone based DOT 5
fluid has a number of problems of it's own.</p>
<p>Essentially all problems with Glycol fluid can be traced to
contamination and fluid age. Part of the problem is that Glycol brake
fluids have always been a service item but until recently, they aren't
in the maintenance schedules. This left people mistakenly thinking that
the fluid never needed to be changed. Like Antifreeze, Glycol brake
fluid contains additives that degrade with age. The failure of those
additives leaves the system open to corrosion and accelerated wear.
Absorbed moisture also lowers the boiling point of the fluid.</p>
<p>Various articles in the trade publications report that long term
tests show increased wear in the calipers and MC when used with
Silicone. Many people don't know that Glycol fluids leave a lubricating
film on the moving parts. Silicone apparently doesn't leave an adequate
film resulting in accelerated wear. </p>
<p>The fact Silicone won't draw water is not entirely a good thing.
Water that gets into the system can collect in low spots and eat the
metal parts. The trapped water can cause spot corrosion in the system
that can lead to line rupture or seal failure. Because Glycol fluids
disperse water and contain corrosion inhibitors, this is a non-issue
with them. If a DOT 3 or DOT 4 filled component corrodes from the
inside then it's an indication that the fluid should have been changed
a long time ago. </p>
<p>Water puddles stuck in the system can boil at lower temperature than
Wet DOT 3's 284&deg;F. Remember that water boils at 212&deg;F(100&deg;C). Worse,
because the boiling point increases with pressure, water on the edge of
boiling can flash to steam after you release the pedal. You'll have
full pedal one second, nothing the next and you won't have any warning
before it happens. </p>
<p>Example. You are entering a turn with brakes already hot. We'll say
the water slug is at 200&deg;F. You press the pedal and heat them even more.
Now the water is at 220-230&deg;F or more but because of the high pressure,
the water slug can't boil in this turn. As soon you let off the pedal,
the water flashes to steam and kills the brakes. Next turn you eat
cones or worse. (Don't get me wrong... any boil is just as bad and will
kill the system. This is just an illustration of the worst way it can
occur.)</p>
<p>A very big issue is that Glycol doesn't mix with Silicone.
Conversion to Silicone requires a total overhaul of the system. To
convert to Silicone, all the calipers and MC must be torn down,
cleaned, rebuilt, and only Silicone fluid used to lube during assembly.
You also have to figure out what to do with the balance block and lines
to get rid of every drop of the old Glycol fluid. Slugs of old Glycol
based fluid in a system converted Silicone can have the same result as
water slugs. You'll simply encounter problems at higher temperatures.</p>
<p>If you want high boiling point, without the problems of conversion
to Silicone, then look into using one of the many new "High
Temperature" DOT 3 compatible formulas on the market. I use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181137/http://www.valvoline.com/" target="_blank">Valvoline</a>
Synthetic Brake Fluid. Unlike Silicone, this product can be mixed with
DOT 3 and DOT 4 fluids. With these, all you need is a decent flush to
gain the benefit of better fluid. (In race applications, you need a
very good flush but not a total system overhaul.)</p>
<h2>Want To Know More?</h2>
<p>Read the actual FMVSS specification by following the links page. It
defines all kinds of data for system wear and corrosion protection. At
23 pages, this specification is one of the larger ones. It even
explains the testing criteria used to determine fluid grade.</p>
<p>Wilwood Engineering and Baer Racing, well-known performance brake
system builders, do not recommend Silicone in any vehicle for street or
race use. Both companies have high temperature fluids they
recommend or manufacture.</p>
<p>Here's another good article. This on is from RPMnet.com and
explains why racing brake fluid is very often certified as lowely DOT 3
even with 500&deg;F or greater Dry boiling point. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181137/http://www.afcoracing.com/tech_pages/fluid.shtml" target="_blank">Under
