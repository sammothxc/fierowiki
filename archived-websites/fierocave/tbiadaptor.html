<h1>How do I test the fuel pressure? </h1>

<h2>TBI doesn't have a Schrader valve.</h2>
<p><strong>The adapters are not made to be use permanently.</strong> Avoid bending the lines. 
If needed, remove clamps holding the lines and make sure nothing will hit them.</p>

<p>Some will tell you to use something like this...</p>

<p><img width="273" height="213" src="tbiadaptor/image001.jpg"></p>

<p>It goes in place of fuel filter. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181122/http://www.otctools.com/products/gm_tbi_fuel_pressure_adapter" target="_blank">This one</a> is made by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181122/http://www.otctools.com/" target="_blank">OTC Tools</a>. (It has been update.) There's other. It will
work but there is another option... 87-88 L4 owners buy EQUUS3641 <span class="text">Equus GM TBI Fuel Injection Adapter. It comes with an extension
hose. Use search to get best price.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" width="183" height="145" src="tbiadaptor/image002.jpg"></p>

<p>It comes by itself or with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181122/http://www.actron.com/product_detail.php?pid=16175" target="_blank">gauge</a>
from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181122/http://www.actron.com/" target="_blank">Actron</a>. See auto part
store near you or buy it online. (See link to order online. Under &quot;PARTS
&amp; ACCESSORIES&quot; is adaptor only.)</p>

<h2>Where does it go?</h2>
<p>They work with or replaced fuel filter. 87-88 Fiero fuel filter is under the car.</p>
<h3>Big type</h3>
<p>Temporarily to replace the fuel filter.</p>

<h3>Small type</h3>
<p>Connected to inlet or outlet side of the fuel filter.</p>

<p>700 TBI 87-88 Fiero... It doesn't fit in the TBI without bending the lines.
To avoid going under the car to access filter, try rubber fuel line by the battery. 
(I have not test it!)</p>

<h2>What is the fuel pressure?</h2>

<p>Pressure is 9-13 PSI. All Years.</p>

<p>Notes:<br>
If testing at fuel filter, make sure it flows. A block fuel filter is
not good and test filter inlet causes an error in testing.<br>
Too low? First Pinch off return line for a minute. If pressure is high now then TBI regulator has problems.</p>
