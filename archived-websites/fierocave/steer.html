<h1>Fiero (Saginaw) Steering Column Notes</h1>

<p>While written for Fiero, this section applies to many GM vehicles. It even
applies to cars from other manufacturers using Saginaw steering columns.</p>

<h2>Warning! </h2>

<p class="warn">Failure of any part of the steering column can result in injury
or death! If you have any question of the quality of the column or a component
then replace it! Do Not drive a car with a damaged column.</p>

<p class="warn">Do NOT attempt to repair the tilt unit unless you know exactly
what you are doing, or have the help of someone who has done this work
regularly. Tilt steering columns contain very strong springs that can hurt you
if not properly handled. </p>

<p class="warn">Do Not pry on or strike cast parts. They will likely break.</p>

<p class="warn">Do Not strike the shaft to remove the steering wheel. This will
damage the shaft and flex joint in tilt units.</p>

<p class="warn">Don't discard the plastic trim that snaps on the lock plate. The
trim helps prevent objects from entering the column. Foreign objects in the
column could cause a short circuit or damage the turn signal parts.</p>

<p class="note">Note: To remove the steering column you must <u>remove</u> the
pinch bolt from the universal joint under the dash to disconnect the column.
The shaft is notched so that even if the bolt is loose the joint won't come
off. (This applies to the universal at the steering rack as well.)</p>

<h2>Pictures of the Column Guts</h2>

<p>There are pictorials of most of the column disassembly at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181140/http://www.fieros.de/" target="_blank">Oliver's Fiero Pages</a> and 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181140/http://www.crankshaftcoalition.com/wiki/images/d/d6/Jazzman_Steering_Rack_Rebuild.pdf" target="_blank">JazzMan is here(PDF, Right Click and use Save Link)</a>. This
should help you with all the common fixes, including the flopping tilt unit
problem. </p>
<h2>My steering has issues...</h2>

<p>First need to isolate which part of the system has the problem.</p>

<p>Quicker way:</p>

<ol style="margin-top:0in" start="1" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Need a big Vise-Grip and a helper.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Use Vise-Grip to lock input shaft on the rack. (Hold it against
     the frame for best results.)</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Turn steering wheel left and right.</li>
</ol>

<p>Better? Rack got a problem</p>

<p>Same? Steering column or intermediate shaft is damage.</p>

<p>Steering vs. intermediate shaft just need to move vise grip to top section, above
upper U joint, and then test again.</p>

<p>Better? Intermediate shaft has damage. Get another Intermediate shaft.</p>

<p>Same? Column likely lost plastic &quot;shear&quot; or Tilt Ball. If the Shear is bad then need another steering column.</p>

<h2>Does the top of your Tilt Steering column flop around?</h2>

<p>There are 4 screws buried deep in the tilt head that cause this. This
problem can usually be fixed but it requires the complete tear down of the top
end of the column. Unless you have worked on steering columns before, I really
don't recommend that you fix this problem yourself. It requires several special
tools to get the thing apart and the experience to know when to scrap a part or
the entire column. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Failure of any part of the steering column can result in
injury or death!</span></p>

<p>For those who do attempt this, there are several areas that must be
inspected carefully. If ANY of these areas shows damage or wear it must be
fixed properly. The column must be scrapped in some cases. You will also need
some special tools that often cost around the same amount as a salvaged column
would. I do work on columns semi regularly, so I have the tools. It really
isn't worth buying/making the tools if a salvage column can be found. </p>

<p>Be careful as you take the column apart. There are things in there that
could hurt you. There are also some loose ball bearings. Make sure you don't
lose anything. Lay out the parts in the order you remove them. If you run into
problems then stop and get help. Don't guess.</p>

<p>The tilt unit can be fixed in the car, but make sure you have something to
keep all the little parts and screws organized. Many of those little parts
aren't easy to replace if you loose them. Egg boxes come in handy for this.</p>

<p>When you dig down to them the 4 screws should be removed. Clean and dry the
screws and holes. Apply Loc-Tight, and install the screws. You don't want to
have to do this twice. Don't over torque the screws! Cross-tighten them or you
could break the aluminum tilt body.</p>

<h3>Tilt Pivot Pins</h3>

<p class="note">Notes: <br>The tilt spring must be removed before pulling the pivot
pins.<br>Screw is NOT metric. Tilt pin puller screw = SAE 8-32.</p>

<p>If you are doing this type of work frequently, the tool to remove the Pivot
pins from the column is available thru 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181140/http://www.lislecorp.com/" target="_blank">Lisle Tools.</a><img src="steer/19940c.jpg" align="left"></p>

<p class="quote">
Part #: 19940<br>Pivot Pin Remover.<br>Removes the pivot pin on GM, Ford and Chrysler 
tilt and telescoping Saginaw steering columns.<br>Skin-packed.<br> </p>


<p>You can make a puller from a small iron pipe cap, nut and screw. Stainless
steel screws are stronger if you can get them. Drill a hole in the cap and use
the nut and screw to pull the pin. (Use the smallest cap that will clear the
pin.)</p>

<p>You could also use a nut screw and a hammer but be very careful or you could
break the casting! Buying or making a puller is safer if the pins are stuck
tight. In this case, you want a nut that is big enough to pass over the pin.
You want to pry against the nut, not directly on the casting. Again, be very
careful or you can break the casting.</p>

<h2>Do you have an automatic transmission? </h2>

<h3>(Transmission Ignition Interlock)</h3>

<p>Note: Information on the ignition interlock was moved to <a href="shift_auto.htm">the auto shifter article</a> 
in the "Axle and Transmission" department. </p>

<h2>So you think a Ignition Switch is bad? And you have a Tilt Wheel?</h2>

<p>Maybe the switch is bad but another item... Linkage section between Switch and Lock gets bent.</p>
<p><img src="steer/tiltlinkname.jpg"></p>

<p>Check very carefully the linkage. Linkage can die as well because bad switch overloads it. 
If link is anything but straight then is bad. Do Not try to fix it. 
Bend then straighten makes it weak so replacement is only option. 
Check gear teeth to.</p>

<p><img src="steer/tiltbend.jpg"></p>

<p>To buy a new linkage, NAPA or Dorman's HELP! is the answer at most auto part store.</p>

<p>Always replace ignition switch when you replace linkage! <i>You do not want to replace the linkage twice!</i></p>

<h2>Column Service Items</h2>

<p>Below is a list of common service items in the steering column. It is not a
list of every part in there. The Prime Rule for fixing the column is &quot;If in
Doubt, Throw It Out!7quot; Do Not take chances with iffy parts.</p>

<p>OTC = Over The Counter. Try local parts outlets, or GM/Pontiac dealer part
departments. Take the bad part with you. Check the red &quot;HELP&quot; blister
packages for the ignition rack gear, and turn signal selector. </p>

<h3>Used Steering Columns</h3>

<p>This column can be found in a number of GM cars. That I'm aware of, all of
these Saginaw columns are the same except for some trim at the base of the
tube. The trim is removable. Take your bad column with you just to make sure
you get one that is correct.</p>

<p>Salvage operations will rarely let you have just a part off a column. If you
have to go to this much trouble you may as well get the whole thing. 2 Bolts, 2
Studs, and a bolt through the universal joint under the dash hold the column.
Note: You must <i>remove</i> the pinch bolt from the universal joint to
disconnect the column. </p>

<p>The straight and Tilt columns are interchangeable. I think the
Tilt/Telescope units are also interchangeable but I can't say for sure that
they will fit properly in Fiero.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are many parts for the column available via the GM dealer network. My
feeling is that if you have to go to that much trouble, it's easier to just get
a good column.</p>

<p>The following parts for the column are confirmed available thru MotorMite's
HELP! Series.</p>
