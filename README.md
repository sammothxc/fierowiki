FieroWiki is a free, independent knowledge base and archival project for everything related to the **Pontiac Fiero** â€” the innovative American mid-engined sports car produced by Pontiac from 1984 to 1988.

This wiki aims to gather technical documentation, historical resources, restoration guides, and community knowledge in one organized, searchable place.
