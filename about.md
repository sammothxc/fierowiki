# About FieroWiki

FieroWiki is an independent, community-focused archive and knowledge base dedicated to preserving and sharing information about the **Pontiac Fiero:** the first and only mid-engined sports car ever produced by Pontiac and the first mass-produced mid-engine sports car in America.

<br>

## Mission

The goal of FieroWiki is simple: to **preserve and organize** the collective knowledge of the Fiero community before it disappears.  
Too many original Fiero websites, forums, and technical resources have vanished over the years, lost to server shutdowns, expired domains, or lack of a maintainer.  
FieroWiki exists to bring that information back together, properly attributed and organized, in one place for **educational and historical purposes**.

<br>

## What You’ll Find Here

- Restoration guides and repair tips

- Technical documents and service data

- Archived websites and manuals

- Community-contributed projects and research

- Historical materials related to the Fiero’s design and legacy

All information is provided in good faith to support Fiero owners and enthusiasts.  
FieroWiki does not sell products, collect advertising revenue, or operate for profit.

<br>

## Preservation Efforts

FieroWiki aims to archive at-risk online resources (such as older personal sites or defunct forums) to prevent their loss.  
Archived materials are always credited to their original authors whenever possible, with clear source links and archival metadata.

If you are the creator or copyright holder of any archived content and wish to have it modified or removed, please see the [Contact page](/contact).

FieroWiki content is also mirrored continuously on the [FieroWiki GitHub repository](https://github.com/sammothxc/fierowiki) and periodically backed up offline to help ensure long-term preservation.

## The Vision

The Pontiac Fiero represents an important chapter in automotive history, an innovative project that still inspires creativity and passion decades later.
