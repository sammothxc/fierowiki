## ðŸ“‚ Files and Downloads

Larger files such as PDFs, videos, 3D files/scans, and other archived materials are hosted on FieroWikiâ€™s file server, **FieroFile**.
These files use links beginning with the base URL [`https://fierowiki.samwarr.dev/api/public/dl/`](https://fierowiki.samwarr.dev/api/public/dl/).
Downloads linked in this manner are considered part of the FieroWiki website.

> While FieroWiki takes precautions against malware by scanning files with various tools, all third-party content is hosted as-is.
FieroWiki cannot guarantee that all hosted files (especially executables!) are completely safe. Always use caution when downloading files.
