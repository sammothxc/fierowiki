<h1>Servicing GM Direct Ignition System </h1>

<p class="warn">Warning: DIS coils
generate considerably more power than many stock distributor based ignition systems.
DIS ignition can kill you. Do not touch DIS components or sparkplug wires with
the engine running.</p>

<p>DIS here means DIS2 is GM system design and not number of coils. Same system is used by V6 and V8 but uses a different CPS setup. Some GM documents have DIS2 but most only DIS. If you see old cars with DIS then most engines have DIS2.</p>

<p>The DIS Brick is far more reliable than distributor-based
ignition however there are 2 costs to this reliability. The first is that the
parts are expensive and the second is that it appears more complicated than it
is which scares allot of people off.</p>

<p>Scaring people off is likely a good thing in light of the
first cost. DIS parts add up really fast. The PIM alone is $120+ if you fry it.
Then add coils at $30-50 each. If you also manage to damage the ECM then add
another couple hundred dollars. As you can see the last thing you want to do is
replace DIS parts unless they are truly bad.</p>

<p>The truth is that DIS is very simple. The Fiero DIS
&quot;brick&quot; consists of 5 main parts. 2 coils, the PIM(Primary Ignition
Module), the mounting plate, and the Crank Position Sensor which is hidden
under the mounting plate. There are no adjustments at all as the PIM and the
ECM control the whole system. Parts in DIS systems mostly work or they don't.
(Ancillary parts include 2 screws 4 carriage bolts with nuts and the PIM
shield.)</p>

<h2>How DIS works. </h2>
<h3>In very short form.</h3>

<p>The only moving part in DIS is the crankshaft notch wheel.
The crank position sensor generates pulses as the cuts in the notch wheel pass
by it.</p>

<p>The ECM and PIM control Spark timing based on pulses from
the crank position sensor and a number of other factors. (Proper operation of
the MAP sensor is critical. The ECM uses the MAP sensor to calculate Vacuum
Advance for the spark amongst other things.)</p>

<p>Coil selection is done by the PIM based on the input from
the crank position sensor. </p>

<p>Spark plugs are wired in series to fire in pairs. One plug
of the pair is in the cylinder under compression and the other is in a spent
cylinder under exhaust.</p>
<p>Note that on all DIS2 setups; One plug on each coil fires "backwards," meaning spark goes from ground to tip. Some DIS setups look similar but all plugs fire as normal, spark goes from tip to ground.</p>

<p>Exact firing order doesn't matter as long as the sparkplugs

<h2>Code 42 EST error &amp; Grounds</h2>

<p>Any time you see
DTC 42, Electronic Spark Timing, check both the ground wires for the ignition
module very carefully. If either are damaged this error is one of the possible results.</p>
<ul>
<li>The reference ground runs to the ECM. Check the harness between the engine
and firewall for damage. If the exhaust was ever cracked/leaking then this
section of harness may have damage.</li>

<li>Power Ground running to the engine is for the module and coil to give you spark voltage. Depending on the setup, the main ground runs to a bolt on the bell housing
or the stud bolt on the brick. (Most Fiero use the trans bell housing bolt near the DIS Brick.) </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="heiground.htm">More Grounding issues...</a></p>

<p class="note">Is the PIM shield missing? Can cause Code 42 error! </p>
<p>Once you eliminate grounds etc first then may need a PROM update. See <a href="VSSpatch.htm#prom">87-88 DIS Duke ECM</a>.</p>
<h2>The PIM shield plate</h2>

<p class="warn">When the shield is missing, you can damage the PIM simply by installing the coils. The seals around the coil 
terminals are designed to seal thru the thickness of the shield. Without the shield the seals are over compressed 
and can cause so much pressure the PIM actually fractures.</p>

<p><img align="left" width="315" height="258" src="gmdis_files/shield-ani.gif" title="Shield Use" alt"animation showing shield and it's use.">
At first glance you'd think the galvanized steel shield on top of the PIM was
part of it. Since it is stuck on tight enough to stay in place by itself
that first impression gets reinforced. </p>
<p class="note">The fact is that the shield IS NOT part
of the PIM and needs to be transferred to any new PIM installed in the brick.
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">DO NOT discard it.</span> The shield is not included with new PIMs! 
If the plate is lost you may have problems with the ignition. The only 
places to get a replacement are your local Pontiac/GM dealer or a scrap yard.</p>

<p>The shield provides <i>magnetic shielding</i> for the PIM. The coils build and break dense 
magnetic fields and can generate stray signals in surrounding parts. 
There maybe thermal protection for the coils or PIM but it not the main function.
 </p>

<p>Keep in mind that when you heat the coils the internal
resistance rises as well. This means the coils will lose power. They can lose
so much power the car will die until they cool down. At the very least you
loose spark energy and end up with reduced performance and gas mileage.</p>

<p>One last thing... See the orange seal pieces on the coil connection? 
They will seal Thru the shield to the Coils. When the PIM doesn't has the 
shield over compressing of the seal will cause a blowout in the PIM. 
No shield can cause a short or even a fire. Like this... (Click on image if you want it bigger.)</p>

</a></p>

<h3>Make a Shield?</h3>
<p>Made from Sheet Steel with Galvanize. I think its 19 gauge...</p>
<p>My only shield is in my car... And I'm not pulling it to measure directly... Measure gap I get 0.046... 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181122/http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/scales/sheetmetal.html">This page</a> says 19 gauge in sheet w/ galvanized.</p>
<p>Likely can use 18-20 ga sheet w/ Galvanized... seal has some give... maybe use dielectric grease w/ 18 to be sure</p>


<h2>DIS Sensors</h2>
<h3>MAT</h3>

<p><img align="left" width="180" height="206" src="gmdis_files/mat.gif" title="MAT sensor" alt="Mat sensor">
The Manifold Air Temperature sensor, also listed as Air Charge
Temperature sensor in many parts books, is located to the right of the TBI in
the intake manifold. It is an uncoated NTC Thermistor exposed directly to manifold
air. NTC, Negative Temperature Coefficient, means the resistance drops as
temperature rises.</p>

<p>This sensor is used mainly to fine tune the fuel air mix. If
it's covered in carbon or cooked by engine backfire, it can cause strange
problems and may or may not set ECM codes.</p>

<p>Problems with this sensor often show up during idle. At idle the air 
moves slower and has time to heat up as it passes thru the intake plumbing. 
The sensor is more sensitive to error as the temperature increases. </p>

<p>Carbon build up or cooking can alter the sensor resistance by a few
ohms. At low temperature, a few ohms of error are a small percentage of the
sensor resistance. However as temperature rises, the percentage of error
increases as the sensor resistance drops.</p>

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Intake Air<br>Temperature</th>
<th>Normal<br>MAT Resistance</th>
<th>Error</th>
<th>% Error</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>low</td>
<td>3500 Ohms</td>
<td>20 Ohms</td>
<td>0.57</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>high</td>
<td>150 Ohms</td>
<td>20 Ohms</td>
<td>13.33</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>What this means is that when intake air temp is up around
130-150F, common during idle, the sensor is lying to the ECM. The ECM adjusts
the fuel mix based on this and if the lie is big enough you'll get 44 or 45
errors.</p>

<p>To make this even more annoying, the ECM error may only show
up under certain weather conditions. When my 87 did this, the error only
occurred when the outside air was very dry. That made it very hard to find the
problem since the air in Delaware only gets that dry a few days in the winter. </p>

<p>Even when it wasn't throwing 45 errors it was still
affecting fuel economy and performance. This sensor is supposed to be accurate within plus/minus 1 degree C. If we figure the high temperature as 65C(about 150F) then a 20% error is plus/minus 13C(about 30F) of error. This can drive the engine rich or lean depending on if the ECM thinks the air is 30 degrees hotter or cooler than it really is. 
</p>

<h4>Replacement</h4>

<p>When you replace the MAT make sure the new one has a plastic
cage. You do not want the metal caged one. The metal caged sensor uses a coated
Thermistor. The coating will slow the response time of the sensor. You don't
want this for a sensor that commonly has to respond to 100 degree temperature
changes in a couple seconds.</p>

<h4>Why doesn't the V6 have this problem?</h4>

<p>The V6 ACT is mounted upstream from the Throttle body and is
far less prone to carbon contamination. It's next to impossible to cook it. The
location also runs cooler so that when there is an error it has less effect on
the signal to the ECM.</p>

<p>The V6 also uses a coated sensor. The coating isn't a
problem for the V6 because the air temperature doesn't change as much or as
fast where it's located. </p>

<h3>MAP</h3>

<p>The MAP, Manifold Absolute Pressure, sensor is used for both fuel mixture and ignition 
timing. It is also used briefly during startup to measure the local barometric pressure, 
which helps the engine compensate for altitude and weather. If this
sensor is batty you will have trouble and it often will not set an error code.</p>

<p>One typical symptom is when you punch the gas and the car
backfires or stumbles.</p>

<p>This first thing you have to do is make sure the sensor
vacuum line is good. It has to be clean inside, have all joints sealed tightly, 
and be connected to the correct vacuum port. Even a tiny
leak will screw up this sensor.</p>

<p>Keep the vacuum line short so that the MAP sensor
will respond instantly to manifold pressure changes. A long vacuum line will
take longer to pass the change in pressure to the MAP. This lag can be enough
to cause a problem. The exact effect depends on the inside diameter of the line
and how long it is.</p>

<p>Don't count on new sensors being good. I've had the
stumbling problem and when I did it was a new MAP sensor that caused it. I
changed the sensor again, this time to Borg Warner product, and the problem
went away.</p>
<h4>Map Test</h4>
<p>This is a basic test described in many manuals...</p>
<p>Measure voltage of the MAP sensor's output terminal (Center terminal of most GM ones) with
 ignition on and engine off. 
Start engine and apply 10 in.(250 mm) Hg to unit, voltage should be 1.2 to 2.3 volts less.
</p>

<h4>What is Absolute Pressure?</h4>

<p>Absolute Pressure means that Zero PSI is referenced to an Absolute Vacuum,
instead of Atmospheric Pressure like your Tire Gauge. Absolute Pressure is used
because it simplifies the engine computer and sensors, especially with
Turbo/Super charging setups.</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolute Pressure is often marked as PSIA, short for &quot;Pounds per Square
Inch, Absolute.&quot;</li>
<li>Atmospheric Pressure is about 14.7 PSIA depending on altitude and weather.</li>
</ul>

<h3>CPS</h3>

<p><img align="left" width="180" height="232" src="gmdis_files/cps2.gif" title="Crank Position Sensor" alt="Crank Position Sensor">
The Crank Position Sensor is pretty reliable. When it does
fail it can be very hard to test.</p>

<p>The problem with testing the sensor is that you can't
monitor it while the car is running like you can with other DIS setups. You can
try to check it during cranking but that doesn't always help either. The
problem may only show up with the engine actually running.</p>

<p>Resistance isn't a reliable test either. The resistance can
be perfect but the sensor can still be bad.</p>

<p>If you pull a crank sensor out and find any cracks, other
than a little flaking by the tip, then replace the sensor. If the sensor shows
signs that something hit it, you need to find out what is happening. There is
nothing in the engine that should ever hit the sensor.</p>


<h4>Layout of the CPS</h4>

<p><img width="432" height="186" hspace="12" src="gmdis_files/cps.gif" title="CPS Drawing" alt="CPS Drawing"></p>
<p>The magnet in the CPS is simply touching the core. There is
no other attachment like a weld or adhesive.</p>

<p>Cracking of the CPS shell can damage the coil or create a
gap between the magnet and core, effectively killing the sensor.</p>

<h4>Replacement</h4>
<p>Pack the terminals of the sensor with dielectric compound.</p>
<p>Clean the hole in the block. Make sure there's nothing that will chew up the new O ring.</p>
<p>Oil the block opening and the new O ring before inserting the sensor.</p>


<h2>Disassembly </h2>

<p>The brick is held to the block by 3 bolts. 2 bolts are 10mm
hex heads; the third is a 13mm hex w/ stud. The hex w/ stud at first glance
looks like a nut on a stud but it is not. </p>

<p>The coils and PIM are held to the mounting plate by 4
5/16(they are really metric but 5/16 6 point sockets fit just fine) nuts on
carriage bolts. Yes. The coils can be removed from the brick on the car but
there is a trick to it. Notes on that are farther down this page.</p>

<p>The Crank sensor is on the back of the mounting plate and it
held by 2 hex head screws. Carefully inspect the sensor's O-ring for damage as
soon as you pull the brick. The sensor hole in the block tends to have rust
that will damage the O-ring. If there is oil above the O-ring when you pull the
sensor then at the very least the O-ring is bad.</p>

<h2>Service &amp; assembly </h2>

<p>If the crank position sensor shows any impact damage to the
face, consider checking inside of the engine. Nothing should contact the face
of the sensor. This is a bit of a judgment call. If the sensor breaks, unlikely
but possible, then it can hit the crank and get chewed up. Note: The plastic on
the face of the sensor is thin and sometimes flakes off. That won't hurt anything.
What we're worried about are signs of impact to the sensor.</p>

<p>If the O ring on the sensor has leaked replace it. This
sensor is about 20$us. I really recommend replacing it if the thing it old
enough for the O-ring to go bad. When the sensor is replaced you MUST use dielectric
grease on the terminals. Pack the grease into the terminals and leave a small
blob on the tip of the terminals. This grease MUST be checked and replaced as
needed anytime the sensor is separated from the PIM. </p>

<p>The PIM (Primary Ignition Module) and mounting plate must be clean! The
mounting plate does not have to shine but it must be free of all dirt, scale,
or corrosion. You should apply heat sink compound or dielectric grease to the
engine side of the module. This isn't as critical as I used to think but I
still recommend it. (GM actually installed these dry.) Besides improved heat
transfer, the grease will seal out water. Water of course can cause corrosion
that will reduce heat transfer.</p>

<p>Dielectric is available at many auto parts and electrical supply stores. Heat
sink compound is available at Radio Shack and most other electronic suppliers.
Make a good gob in the center of the PIM and let it spread itself when the PIM
and coils are tightened. Allowing the heat sink or dielectric compound to
spread itself is important. As the compound spreads it drives out air from
between the parts. If we were to try and spread the compound by hand we'd end
up with air trapped between the parts. Air doesn't transfer heat as well as the
compound so the less air in there the better.</p>

<p>While not required I strongly recommend packing the coil
primary terminals with dielectric grease. These are the 2 small holes in the
bottom of the coils. These are supposedly weather packed terminals but the
extra protection is a really good idea. Also pack the secondary posts where the
terminals exit the towers after the coils are tightened. </p>

<p>Tighten the coils and PIM in a star pattern. If you tighten
unevenly or over tighten the nuts you could damage the PIM. Go slow to allow
the heat sink compound to spread.</p>

<p>Before attaching the brick to the block make sure the crank
position sensor hole is clean. It tends to have rust around it that will damage
the sensor's O-ring. Oil the O-ring before pushing the sensor in the block. The
3 mounting bolts should be put back where they came from.</p>

<p class="warn">WARNING! The
TOP bolts penetrate the crankcase and MUST be wrapped with Teflon thread
sealing tape prior to installation or you WILL have an oil leak. </p>

<p>You don't have to wrap the whole bolt, just 2-3 turns near the tip. The
bolts will be easy to start if you don't wrap the first few threads. The
advantage to tape over RTV Silicone is that the tape will seal an oily hole
where Silicone may not.</p>

<p>Before connecting the brick to the wiring harness pack the
terminals on the harness with a small amount of dielectric. Again this is
insurance. The Fiero DIS brick is mounted low. It isn't hard to swamp it in a
big rain. Swamping the brick can ruin both the PIM and the ECM. ((Oddly as I
was preparing this document, TNN's Shade Tree Mechanic aired a show about a
swamped GM that did exactly this. Too weird.)) </p>

<h3>Servicing coils and PIM without removing brick from car.</h3>

<p>It's generally easier to work on the coils and PIM with the
brick removed from the car but that creates other problems. The first is that
you disturb the crank sensor, which can damage it or its seal. Second is that
you unseal the mounting bolts. Both problems can result in oil leaks.</p>

<p>The coils and PIM can be removed with the brick in place but
you need to make a small tool to hold the carriage bolt heads. The tool is a
6-inch or longer piece of 1/2 to 3/4 inch wide flat stock. This needs to be
pretty stiff and not more than about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. It doesn't matter
what kind of metal is used. Brass aluminum or steel are all ok. To make the
tool bend about 1 1/4 inches of metal 90 degrees. You'll use the bent part to
hold the bolts.</p>

<p>To remove a coil, pull up on it as you alternately loosen
both nuts. This will keep the bolt heads seated in the mounting plate. Note: If
you are only replacing the coils do one coil at a time. This saves you having
to reapply heat sink compound to the PIM. ((If the PIM hasn't been off in a
long time it doesn't hurt to check it out and clean any crud from around it.))</p>

<p>Once the coils are off check over the PIM as above. Clean
the mounting plate as needed, etc, before reseating the PIM. Don't forget to
always apply fresh heat sink and dielectric compounds every time the PIM is
off.</p>

<p>Only the top left coil bolt is close enough to the block to
stay in place by itself. Pull up the other bolts one at a time and reach under
the plate with the tool to hold the heads in place. The top right bolt is
easiest to reach from the right side of the plate. The lower ones are easiest
to reach from the bottom of the plate.</p>

<p>Tighten all 4 coil nuts until they are just touching the
coils. Final tighten the nuts slowly in a star pattern. You want to go slow to
let the heat sink compound spread. The stuff is thick and spreads slowly. Go
around the coil nuts a couple times to make sure they are tight. (They can
loosen as the compound spreads after the first pass.)</p>



<h2><a name="prom"></a>DIS PROMS</h2>
<p class="note">Section moved to <a href="VSSpatch.htm#prom">87-88 DIS Duke ECM</a>.</p>


<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Unlike HEI the DIS PIM is rather unlikely to die. If you
think the PIM is dead always try replacing the crank sensor. The crank sensor
is $20 the PIM is $120+. If you do replace a PIM you might as well replace the
crank sensor at the same time. ((GM says the crank sensor passing a resistance
test of doesn't mean its good. So if you think it's bad just replace it. Almost
no-one has the machine to test them fully.))</p>

<p>The main thing to fail in DIS is the coils and that's often
because a sparkplug or wire is bad. A damaged plug or wire can fry DIS coils by
creating increased current demand on the coils. This increased demand increases
heat in the coils. The coils should be replaced in pairs. When coils are
replaced you should also replace sparkplugs and wires. </p>

<p>The only test I've found for the coils in GM documents is
secondary resistance. (Resistance between towers.) The resistance should be
between 5000 and 7000 Ohms. Problem is that even if the coil secondary
resistance is ok the coils can still be bad. Mainly you could have a bad primary
winding or the insulation could be failing neither of which you can easily test
for sure. (Failed insulation doesn't always result in spark leakage that can be
seen.) My own testing of the Primary shows about 1 Ohm. At such a low
resistance it's hard to tell if it's got a problem other than an open circuit.
(The only true test of insulation resistance requires a special machine called
a Megger and few people own one.)</p>

<p>DIS uses a 0.060 inch plug gap. Make sure all plugs are as close
to this gap as possible. Mismatched plug gaps will unbalance the DIS coils and
hurt performance. Unbalanced plug pairs are a good source of rough idle
problems and miss. NEVER over gap sparkplugs in DIS systems to prevent fouling.
You may prevent fouling but you'll cook the coils. (This huge gap is allot of
why many &quot;performance&quot; spark plugs make little or no performance gain.)</p>

<p>The location of the DIS brick on the &quot;Iron Duke&quot; makes it
run hot. This has been known to cause problems when aftermarket coils are
installed. Aftermarket coils usually draw more current from the PIM resulting
in even more heat. This can be enough to push the PIM or coils to failure. The
system usually will start working correctly when it cools down but permanent
damage can result. Some people have not had this problem, others have. It
depends on the exact PIM, the coils, and presence of the PIM shield. There's no
way to predict if yours will have problems or not. You'll know if you have this
problem when about 8-10 miles after installing the coils the car dies.</p>

<p>The odd bolt-&gt; The stud topped bolt that holds the brick
in place is used as a ground point in other cars using this engine. You may
safely change this bolt to match the other two. This makes the brick easier to
work on since all bolts are now the same. Looks better too. </p>

<h2>Aftermarket Parts</h2>

<p>Researching aftermarket parts is actually what started this
whole page. Problems during that research forced me to find out just how the
DIS system operates and how to work on it in much more detail than I wanted.</p>



<p>Lesson #1, stay with standard sparkplugs. Some brands and
types of &quot;improved&quot; plugs cause problems with DIS. DIS ignition is already much
stronger than traditional distributor ignitions. The benefit of specialty
sparkplugs in DIS is minimal if noticeable at all. I was going to test Bosch
Platinum plugs but numerous reports of problems using this plug in DIS and the
cost of the plugs made me decide it wasn't worth the effort. I did try
SplitFire plugs. I found no difference at all in how the car ran vs. new
Autolite traditional style resistor plugs. </p>

<p>If you feel you need platinum plugs, stay with Autolite or AC &quot;double 
platinum&quot; types. These plugs have a platinum pad on the both electrodes. 
The makers claim this type is designed for use with systems like DIS. The platinum 
pad on the &quot;ground&quot; electrode effectively gives the plug 2 tips and makes 
it easier to fire the &quot;backward&quot; plug in each pair. I have used Autolite double platinum without problems. Bosch platinum's 
have had problems in DIS motors. (Use PFF search in the archives.)</p>


<p>Lesson #2, unless you happen to like yellow allot the DIS
coils from Accell are not a very good product. I found them more heat sensitive
than OE style coils. The coils also require alteration of the $120+ PIM to fit.
The black insert that is supposed to seal the coil primary terminals is likely
to fall out while you work which means it also doesn't properly seal the
terminals. (Since the black piece was already out I altered the coils instead
of the PIM and packed the terminals with Dielectric to prevent moisture
problems.) If you are missing the PIM shield then don't even bother with these
coils. They will heat up in 10-15 miles and shut down the car. (Hot coils
loose efficiency the same way a hot starter does. The internal resistance
climbs to where the coils can't properly fire.) This product is not one of
Accell's better efforts.</p>

<p>Update... I took the Accell coils off for good. I put OE GM coils back on. 
Result? I gained MPG and found no performance change. I'll never use the POS Accell 
DIS coils again.</p>


<p>Lesson #3, you do not need expensive &quot;performance&quot; sparkplug
wires on DIS. The system will work perfectly with any brand of high quality
wires. I'm using a Borg Warner helical core wire set from Pep Boys on my
system. In over 25,000 miles there have been no problems at all with these
wires. I forget what they cost. It wasn't very much.</p>

<p>Update... I finally did wear these out. Took about 3 years and 40,000 miles.
They are &quot;life time warranted&quot; but Pep Boys are pricks about
honoring warranties and wouldn't replace them.</p>


<h2>Additional Information</h2>


<p>ACDelco</a> has a bunch of
technical blurbs on their site. There's a diagram of 4 cyl DIS showing the
crank notch wheel. (It's not the exact Fiero system but it will give you the
idea.)</p>
