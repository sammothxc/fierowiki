<h1>Wire, Wire, Pants on Fire</h1>

<p class="warn">Warning! Before attempting any electrical repairs you must
disconnect the battery. Capacitor banks in cars with large sound systems must
be discharged. Failure to do this can result in fire and/or explosion hazards.</p>

<p>When you disconnect the battery, always take off the ground(s) first. The reason
is that if your tool contacts the car body and negative terminal, you won't
cause a short. If you do the positive first, and hit the body or block, you'll
throw one hell of a spark. That spark can cause a power surge in the car that
can do serious damage.</p>

<p>Discharging capacitors varies some depending on how they were installed. The
easiest way is probably to turn on whatever they are connected to. Be very careful
with these. Capacitors can dump huge amounts of power in a very short pulse
that can easily weld things. Check them with a voltmeter to make sure they are
flat before starting work.</p>

<h2>Good Wire Hunting.</h2>
<p>Several of us keep telling people in the forums to check the various wires
in the car.... Here's a list of common things to check and some of what is
going on with them. These things should be checked anytime you experience
erratic or intermittent performance problems. (Unstable Idle is caused by
electrical problems almost as much as vacuum or timing problems.)</p>

<p>Another factor often forgotten is that Fiero's engine bay is more exposed to
weather than FWD cars using the same engines. Because of the vent grates,
weather gets to the parts in there even when the car is parked. In most FWD
models, the engine is much more protected by the hood and really only allows
weather in the engine bay when the car is in use. This difference means Fiero
often suffers from accelerated corrosion of electrical connections. (In this
case, the term Weather would include things like car washing and anything else
that dumps water down the vent grates.)</p>

<p>Note: While this article is written for GM cars and light trucks, it can be
applied to most cars and trucks. ECM/PCM controlled vehicles are very fussy
about charging system conditions. Corrosion of just one joint can throw the
whole car out of whack. </p>

<h2>Fusible Links</h2>

<p class="warn">WARNING! Fusible links are calibrated wire with special
insulation. Do Not replace them with normal wire. Fuse links are calculated to
specific wire size and length. Do Not splice fusible links! Do Not cut them! If
a fuse link needs a new end, it must be replaced. Do Not solder them!</p>

<p>Fuse Links blows mainly because:
<ul>
<li>Something is shorting out the battery or maybe the Alt
<li>OE FL end(s) are bad and letting water etc at the wire
<li>You/shop did a crap job to replace them and letting water etc at the wire, has loose crimps, etc.
</ul>

<p>The problem is you can't be 100% sure what caused it to
fail unless you load test the circuit. Should you bypass a fuse link to get
going on the road, pay careful attention to the car afterwards. If it failed
because of a short, then you can have a bonfire on your hands real quick. Make
sure you replace the dead link ASAP.</p>

<p>Alternator Fuse Links is not to protect the alt... Alt can short out and when that happens draws 300-400 amps from battery. Same as other Fuse Links. Even ECM standby power has a Fuse Link for this reason.</p>

<p><a href="ecmwire_fl.htm">The ugly details on fuse links.</a></p>
<h3>Why a fuse link and not a cartridge fuse or circuit breaker?</h3>

<p>Fuse links are used in high current circuits like the battery and alternator
outputs. They handle much greater current than normal automotive fuses and
breakers. Fuse link circuits commonly carry 30-100 amps or more. </p>

<p>Most automotive breakers are automatic reset and that is undesirable on
circuits that can easily start fires. Even if you eliminate auto reset, the
increased cost during manufacture isn't justified for something that isn't as
reliable as the fuse link.</p>

<p>Fuse links accept higher surge currents without blowing. This is important
for things like the coolant fan motor, which draws high current at startup.</p>


<h3>Delinking</h3>

<p>Allot of questions come up about replacing fuse links with various other types of
fuse. Generally this is a bad idea and if you do it wrong either you'll blow
fuses when you shouldn't or you'll burn the car down because a fuse didn't blow
that should have. Don't second-guess the carmakers on this. Unless you know
exactly what you are doing this is a very dangerous thing to mess with.</p>

<p>One example, the alternator circuit... Allot of people don't understand why
this circuit is fused and/or why it is always fused at a value that seems
insanely high. </p>

<p>The alternator link/fuse is typically rated 100 amps or more depending on
the alternator and vehicle options.<i> But I only have a 60 to 90-amp alternator.</i> That's true but the link/fuse is almost
always sized to be able to carry the entire output of the alternator and then
some. You will almost never see an alternator fuse fail from overloading the
alternator. (You will however probably kill the alternator.)</p>

<p>Many
people mistakenly think this link/fuse is to protect the alternator. Dumb as it
first sounds, the fuse isn't there to protect the alternator at all. It protects
the car from a short in the alternator or wiring to it. Such a short could potentially
pull hundreds of amps from the battery, likely starting a fire, if the alternator
circuit is left unprotected. The alternator would never directly blow that fuse
but the current from a shorted battery would fry even a 200-amp fuse instantly.</p>

<h2>ECM power</h2>

<p>People forget to check fuses so often it's really sad. Whenever you suspect
an ECM ignition or fuel system problem, this should be the first thing checked.
All too often one of the multiple fuses for these items is popped and no one
has looked here before chasing down the rest of the system.</p>

<p>How many fuses are involved? It varies depending on motor and year.</p>

<p>On the V6 Fiero there are,</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0pt" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="
     vertical-align:middle">The main ECM fuse.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="
     vertical-align:middle">The Fuse Link that provides memory power to the
     ECM.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="
     vertical-align:middle">Two 5 amp Fuel Injector fuses, one for each set of
     3 injectors.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="
     vertical-align:middle">According to schematics, there is also a fuse link
     for the ignition coil.</li>
</ul>

<p>The distributor 4 cylinder is the same for the ECM and coil but does away
with the injector fuses. The single injector is fed from the 10-amp ECM fuse.</p>

<p>The DIS 4 cylinder has the injector, ignition brick, and ECM all sharing the
same 10-amp fuse. The ECM still gets memory power from a fuse link.</p>

<h2><a name="cables"></a>Battery Cables</h2>

<p class="warn">Warning! The OE routing of the positive battery cable is at best
poorly done in many Fiero. As a result, the pulleys and belts can easily damage
the cable. This cable MUST be physically inspected and replaced if there is any
damage.</p>

<p>For 87-88 L4, and likely the earlier years, the cable is factory routed
between the water pump and pulley. Even if all the cable clips etc are perfect,
the cable has enough slack to easily reach the water pump pulley. In many
cases, the cable may rub only under certain engine load conditions.</p>

<p>One giveaway that you've got problems here is to inspect the pump side of
the pulley. If the cable is shorting against the pulley there will likely be rub
and even burn marks on the edge of the pulley.</p>

<p>V6 owners aren't immune to this problem. The extremely cramped V6 setup
makes checking the cable harder while making the cable easier to damage.</p>

<p>When replacing cables, use whatever routing will get the cable away from the
pulleys and exhaust. I ran mine over the water pump on the L4. (If you have the
V5 AC compressor, loop it under the diagonal compressor brace.) Now it is easy
to visually inspect the cable and it is far from the pulleys and exhaust.</p>

<h3>General Notes</h3>
<p>Think weak battery? Test/replace battery and Replace, at least test, battery cables at same time. 
Weak cables are high on the list of screwing up starters.</p>
<p>These obviously need to be clean and tight on the battery but most people
forget or don't know to check the other ends as well. There are several ends
involved and all need to be in good shape or you will have problems. Often the
problems can make you look in all the wrong directions. Things like poor engine
performance and rough idle can often be traced to batty cables and charging
system problems.</p>

<p>The Thin Positive wire from the battery is very important. This thin wire is
what runs everything in the car and charges the battery. If this wire, often a
fusible link, is bad then the car is going nowhere. </p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>You cannot test big wire with common Ohm meter. Most meters uses a tiny battery and can't test much beyond 18 ga.
 Use a Voltage Drop test instead...</b>
<p>Need a good meter &amp; probes, get very good connection at ends of cable, start the engine while watching volt meter. 
&gt;0.2v? Cable is bad or you didn't do test right, likely crappy probes or probe connection at end(s) is suspect. 
(If meter show -v, ignore it... means you got probes backward.)</p>
<p>If engine start easy and you can't read meter, disable ignition by pulling power at module. </p>

<h3>GM &amp; AC Delco replacement battery cables</h3>

<p>These cables are well made using parts from Delphi Automotive. They are very
good cables but there are a few things to keep in mind. (You can't over protect
battery cables in this car...)</p>

<p>The battery end of these cable assemblies is barbed to displace lead on the
battery terminal. This prevents rotation that can loosen the bolt and I expect
they also get a better connection than simple flat terminals. It is important
that these cable ends not be disturbed anymore than absolutely needed. </p>

<p>When possible, you are better off to disconnect the block/body ends of the
cable when you need to work on other electrical components. This will avoid
needlessly tearing up the battery terminal face. Shove the free end(s) into a
pill bottle and tape it in place.</p>

<p>Before you install a new one of these cables, pop out the bolt, pull off the
cover, and coat the crimp with dielectric grease to seal out moisture. You can
also do this to the other end if you push the rubber sleeve up the wire. </p>

<p>When you install these cables on the battery, aim the cable down some so
that any water that gets into the cover can drain.</p>

<p>All AC Delco cables are made as &quot;positive&quot; leads but they all come
in black. Go Figure... This means they all have a fuse link with a length of
wire on them. They give you plenty of wire to work with and it is ok to trim
the wire and/or put a different terminal on the end if needed. Don't alter or
damage the fuse link. (Having a fuse link in the thin ground wire isn't ideal
but it won't hurt anything.)</p>

<h2>C500</h2>

<p>C500 is the large bolt-together terminal block by the battery. (It's on the
firewall for 84.) If you take this apart for any reason, check it over very
carefully. If needed, clean and grease it with dielectric compound. Some of the
wires in this block carry hefty currents. Dirty terminals in here can produce
some bizarre problems. Items like the tachometer feed, coolant fan control,
ignition <i>power</i> and the starter solenoid circuits run through here.
(Exactly what runs through here depends on model engine and year of the car.)</p>

<p>If you have to clean out the block, don't use solvents that will eat
plastic. If you can't get contact cleaner from Radio Shack or some other
electronic supply shop, try brake parts cleaner or EFI cleaner. These should be
more plastics friendly than carburetor cleaner. Test them on a spot where they
can't do any real harm to make sure. Blow the block dry with compressed air
before you pack it with dielectric. (Use a &quot;canned&quot; air product if
need be.) </p>

<p>Note: ECM signals do not run through C500. Sensors and ignition <i>control</i>
lines are wired directly to the ECM through one or two bulkhead seals on the
firewall.</p>

<h2>Power Distribution block</h2>

<p>Note: 84 does not have a Distribution block. See link size and location in <a href="ecmwire_fl.htm#locat">the ugly details on fuse links.</a></p>

<p>The main terminal block is below C500 in most Fiero. With one exception this block caries the power for
the entire car. The only thing not drawing power from this block is the starter
motor.</p>

<p>In my 87SC, the terminal block has a large stud and a small one.</p>

<ul>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="
     vertical-align:middle">The alternator and ECM feed are crimped to a large lug that spans both
terminals. Whenever working on the terminal block, this lug will be the last
one removed and the first one installed.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="
     vertical-align:middle">The large terminal is where the feed from the battery should go.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="
     vertical-align:middle">The small one has two fuse links attached that feed everything else in the
car.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is extremely important that all connections to the terminal block are
clean and solid. This terminal block should be one of the first things checked
when you have electrical problems. There is allot of current flowing thru here
and any corrosion will cause voltage drops that can cripple the whole car. (How
much current? The entire output of the alternator flows thru here. That can be
100 amps or more.)</p>

<p><a href="ecmwire_fl.htm#tblock">Here's a map of the main terminal wiring.</a></p>

<h2>Grounds</h2>

<p>GM usually runs three main grounds. All must be in good shape to prevent
problems.</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0pt" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="
     vertical-align:middle">Battery to Block. Direct run with heavy cable. Main
     purpose is to provide return path for starting current. </li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="
     vertical-align:middle">Battery to Body. Direct run with light wire.
     Secondary return path for body/chassis to battery and alternator. </li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="
     vertical-align:middle">Body to Block, 2 times. Primary return path for body/chassis to battery and alternator.<br>
Head bolt to frame with bare braided
     conductor. Provides return path for most of the car. The braided wire
     carries more current than regular wire. If you replace these, use another
     braided strap.<br>
12 gage wire from trans bell housing bolt to frame. This can rot from road salt etc.
</li>
</ul>

<p>These small grounds will cause major problems:</p>

<p>G101 &amp; G102:<br>
G101 may have two end screwed to the frame. Small wire runs most. Big wire runs radiator fan. Fan problem then check G101 too.<br>
G102 is a redundant thin wire.</p>

<p>G201:<br>
Service manual, Alldata, and some others are wrong for 87-88 cars. 
They say "Splice S201: Main Harness, Above Steering Column" but it looks like a typo. The location in table above is correct.<br>
You can inspect G201 without removing the radio. Look Behind the radio's vinyl shroud on driver side.
</p>

<p>Pontiac seems to have been in the habit of attaching the braded body to
block ground strap to the stud for the deck lid hinge. This isn't the best
place for it. The hinge adds more layers of paint etc. Find a spot to anchor it
to the side of the bracket the hinge is bolted to. You may need to drill a
hole and/or get a longer strap. Make sure the new bolt doesn't interfere with 
anything important.</p>

<p>They also anchored the thin ground from the battery to the battery tray
where it's hard to inspect. I moved mine to the frame lip right next to the
battery. Now I can easily inspect it any time the vent grate is off.</p>

<p>On the 4 cylinders, I don't remember what they did on V6, GM used a stud
topped head bolt for the heavy battery grounds. It's a common problem for that
anchor to corrode heavily. If that happens don't try to force it or you could
rotate the head bolt. Cut the nut off the stud. It doesn't matter much where
you anchor the ground to the head or block as long as it's clean and won't
stress the cables when the engine moves. (Stay off the water pump!)</p>

<p>Many people are familiar with the main grounds but there are also a bunch of
ground wires for the ECM and ignition bolted to the block and transmission bell
housing. These must all be clean and tight. You can get all sorts of weird
errors if these are crappy. Any time you get Ignition or O2 sensor errors you
should check these grounds before doing anything else.</p>

<h2>Cleaning</h2>

<p>When you clean the wire ends, don't forget to
clean whatever hardware and frame holds them. Get everything to bare metal, 
including removing any paint. </p>

<p>Coat the terminals and hardware with grease or better yet dielectric
compound. All you want is a very thin film of grease. In some cases, 
too much might interfere with getting good connections.</p>

<p>With bolt/screw terminals, 
snug the hardware just enough to put pressure on the lugs. Wiggle the lugs
against each other a bit to make sure they get good metal-to-metal contact. Be
careful and don't pull on the wires or bend the lugs.
Tighten the nuts the rest of the way then coat everything with dielectric
grease to help it repel water.</p>

<p>This will keep them from corroding far longer than simply cleaning
them. Dielectric compound is Silicone based and resists washout by chemicals
like engine cleaner or car washes. Don't forget the battery and other terminals
are directly exposed to weather and car washes. Oil and grease is pretty easy
to wash away under these conditions.</p>

<p>There are numerous commercial products to stop corrosion on the battery terminals.
Some work better than others. I find it just as easy to use dielectric compound
on them. This saves buying yet another chemical and works as well or better
than any of the commercial products out there.</p>

<h3>Using Grease/Oil</h3>

<p>Simple... Don't. Grease and oil can kill plastic, some fast and some over
time. Worse, some grease and oil contain metal and other material that will create
a short circuit or a &quot;Soft&quot; Short. Soft short is short with resistances
that won't blow a fuse but it cause a problem all the same.</p>

<p>Dielectric Grease or Light Bulb Grease will be safe. (Bulb Grease will not
run in hot systems.) </p>

<h2>Splicing</h2>

<p>Before you install a crimp terminal, work some dielectric into the wire
strands to seal them. Do this if you use those bolt-together repair ends for
the battery cables. This will keep the wire from drawing water up under the
insulation. On battery ends, it will keep acid out as well.</p>

<p>All splices in sensor wires should be soldered and sealed with weatherproof
shrink tubing. Even small amounts of corrosion in these wires can screw up
signals to the ECM.</p>

<p>If you can't solder:</p>

<ol style="margin-top:0pt" start="1" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Clean
     the wire. Including the insulation! The weatherproof shrink tube likes
     clean surface.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Pack
     the wire with dielectric compound. (It keeps any moisture that gets in
     from eating the joint.)</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Slide
     some weatherproof shrink tube over one of the wires.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Install
     a non-insulated crimp sleeve.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Shrink
     the tubing over the joint.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you can't get weatherproof shrink tube, coat the joint with dielectric
compound and cover it with regular shrink tube. </p>

<p>Do not use standard electrical tape except for emergency repairs. All
emergency repairs must be redone as soon as possible or you'll have trouble
down the road.</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150324010012/http://www.posi-lock.com/" target="_blank">Posi-Lock</a> connectors
are good for emergency or permanent repair of most wire in the car. For sensor
leads, I still recommend a soldered joint but these will work much better than simple
insulated crimp terminals. </p>

<p>This <a href="ecmwire_fl.htm#wiresize">Metric to AWG wire chart</a> may be handy for some people. 
It lists common metric sizes and the correct AWG wire to use with it.</p>

<h2>Weather Pack connectors</h2>

<p>There are several types of weather resistant connectors used by GM. All of
these connectors have silicone seals where the wire enters the shell and
between the shell halves. Under normal conditions, no other sealant or
dielectric is needed.</p>

<p>On connectors in low places, I still pack them with some dielectric
compound. The connectors on the 4 cylinder distributor or DIS brick are good
candidates for this. These connections are low enough to be hammered by deep
puddles.</p>

<h3>Connector Repair</h3>

<p>Weather Pack connectors are used for O2, MAP and other things on all Fiero
models. The shells on these connectors can be replaced without cutting the
wire. You'll need a terminal tool like Lysle # 14900 or MotorMite # 85360. You
can reuse good salvage shells or find new ones thru auto supply shops. (See
links at end of page for other sources.)</p>

<ol style="margin-top:0pt" start="1" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Open
     the back of the shell (Pry up the locking ears on the side of the shell to
     open the cover.)</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Insert
     the release tool into the open end of the shell until it bottoms out. (The
     release tool slides down the outside of the terminal to squeeze the
     locking ears.)</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Pull
     the wire and terminal out the back of the shell.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Insert
     the wire into the same position on the new shell.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">After
     all wires are transferred, close the back cover on the new shell.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Metri-Pack</h2>

<p>Metri-Pack &quot;Pull to Seat&quot; connectors are used for sensors starting with
the 1987 models. &quot;Pull to Seat&quot; connectors are generally smaller than Weather
Pack connectors and they cannot be fixed without cutting the wire. If one of
these connectors is damaged, it will be easier for most people to obtain new
prewired connectors from a parts store or good used ones from a salvage yard
and splice it to the harness. (These &quot;new&quot; connectors are used for IAC TPS MAT
and ECT in the 87-88 Fiero 4 cylinders.)</p>
<h4>Why do they call it "Pull to Seat?"</h4>
<p><a href="ecmwire_wp.htm#pts">See This</a></p>

<p>If you are having trouble identifying a connector type, visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150324010012/http://www.motec.com/" target="_blank">Motec's</a> site. Most of the ones in
Fiero will be in the Weather Pack or the MetriPak P2S pages. If the one you want
isn't shown, this will at least give you an idea which family it belongs to.</p>

<p>Yes, you can get loose parts for Pull to Seat connectors if you really want
them. No, I'm not going to explain how to work with them in this article.</p>

<h2>Packard</h2>

<p>Packard, often marked "PED" (PED = Packard Electric Division), is used on inside wiring. 
Back-loading terminals can be removing with small wire, IE paperclip, or very small screwdriver. 
Too many styles to list here and each one need a different method to remove them.</p>
