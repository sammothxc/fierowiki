<h1>Serpent Belt</h1>
<p class="note">While this article was originally written for Fiero 1987-88 L4, it applies to all vehicles with 
serpent belt systems.</p>

<p class="warn">WARNING: Do not assume that the belt listed in the catalog fits your engine! If the belt forces 
the tension assembly out of range you can and likely will break things.</p>

<p class="warn">WARNING: NEVER force the tension assembly! If you don't break it instantly, it probably won't last long. 
Most tension assemblies have internal stops. IF the tension assembly is actually binding, replace it ASAP or you will 
find yourself stranded someplace, likely someplace nasty, in the near future.</p>

<p class="warn">DO NOT start a car that shows the tension assembly out of range! You will not be able to exchange the 
belt once you run it even a few turns. Running the belt WILL NOT make it fit. (You also want your hands and the pulleys 
clean as most stores won't exchange a filthy item.)</p>

<h2>Tools and Tension Specs</h2>

<h3>Belt Wear</h3>
<p>App and Gauge from Gates are still free. The Gates gauge is much easier to
use on the car. Hole goes on tip of ring finger then you can feel the gauge
area to pass/fail the belt w/o seeing.</p>

<h3>Manual Tension tools</h3> 
<p>Use a wrench to tighten the belt.</p>

<h3>Belt tension</h3>
<p>For use with Krikit tool etc.</p>

<p>Google: krikit gauge</p>
<p>V6 uses small Krikit tool because its test range, 30-150lb, even tho Dayco
says V belt.</p>

<p class="note">Note that a belt is &quot;used&quot; after engine runs just a few seconds.</p>

<h2>Things to remember about serpent belts. </h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Newer EPDM Belts does not show wear</strong> as old rubber that would have cracks. See:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181121/http://www.gatesprograms.com/beltwear/beltwear/" target="_blank">Gates Neoprene Belt Wear vs. EPDM Belt Wear</a>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181121/http://www.daycoproducts.com/training/" target="_blank">DAYCO Training</a> 
<li> 
  When properly tensioned 
  Serpent sets will always out perform V-belts. This is why nearly all Serpent 
  sets use a spring tensioning device. (See note at bottom.) It is critical the 
  belt tensioning device work properly or belt life will be shortened 
  tremendously. Because Serpent sets are carefully calibrated, life of PTO 
  devices is also improved. The alternator, water pump, etc, are all protected 
  from running with an over tightened or loose belt, which protects the bearings 
  and sheaves from excess wear. 
  <li> 
  These belts <b>HATE</b> 
  oil grease and coolant. You'll eat one up in short order if you get one 
  contaminated and don't clean it off. If for example you spill oil during an 
  oil change and it gets on the belt or a pulley you must clean it up. To fully 
  clean it up take off the belt and wash everything in citrus base cleaner or Simple 
  Green. NEVER use parts washer or other solvent on the belt. (Brake Parts Cleaner will 
  work well on the pulleys.)  If you don't get this mess cleaned up 
  then the belt will glaze and start squealing. Once the belt squeals it must be 
  replaced. 
  <li> 
  Make sure the belt is 
  running centered on the Idler pulley. In Fiero this is the smooth pulley that 
  runs on the backside of the belt. If the belt is running off the edge of this 
  pulley then the spring arm has likely gone bad and will have to be replaced. 
  The spring arm cannot be serviced. (Only the bearing in the idler pulley can 
  be replaced.)
  <li> On 
  some cars the Idler may be grooved and other pulleys may be smooth. All the 
  pulleys must line up or you'll eat belts. (The FWD applications of the 2.5 
  often have a smooth water pump pulley.) The belt must never be allowed to run 
  off the edge of a pulley. 
  <li> 
  Whenever the belt is 
  off carefully check the bearings in the idler pulley, water pump, and 
  alternator. (If present check the AC compressor.) If the bearings are sloppy, 
  rumble, or feel &quot;dry&quot; as you turn the shaft then you have other problems 
  besides the belt wearing. 
  <li> 
  When installing the 
  belt it helps to have someone under the car to hold it on the crankshaft and 
  AC pulleys. These are hard to see and new belts tend to have a mind of their 
  own about staying on them.
  <li>
  On Fiero L4 and some others... Slip the belt over the smooth tension pulley last. 
  Let the belt lay between the pulley and the wrench until it is around all the gooved pulleys.
  <li> 
  Keep an emergency belt 
  and the wrench in the car at all times. For an emergency belt I recommend 
  using the belt for cars <i>without</i> AC, even if the car really does have 
  AC. This belt is easier for one person get on from the top with the least 
  amount of mess. It will also give you backup if/when the AC compressor fails 
  and cooks off the belt. (With the age of most AC compressors the chance of 
  this is pretty high.) You can drive a car w/o AC but not a water pump or 
  alternator. (It depends on the car. Fiero 4 cyl's can be run with either the 
  AC or non AC belt. Some cars can't do that trick.) </li>
</ul>

<p>Side note: Some cars use serpent belts in place of V belts, 
and also tension them the same way by adjusting either the Alternator or AC 
compressor. It is critical that these applications be correctly adjusted or the 
belts will not last. Serpent belt material is much more picky about tension that 
V belts. </p>
<h2>Why Does My Belt Keep Failing?</h2>
<p>The first thing to check is pulley alignment and operation of the tensioning 
device. A critical factor here is that pulleys that are close together tollerate much less alignment 
error than pulleys far appart. An AC equiped Fiero will eat belts very fast if the crank, AC and Waterpump pulleys 
are just a little off. A non AC Fiero can take a more error as all the pulleys have longer belt runs.</p>

<p>Make sure every pulley is clean. Make sure nothing is packed into the grooves or 
built up on the peaks. Packed dirt will make problems.</p>

<p>Is oil or coolant getting on the belt? That will kill it fast.</p>

<p>How are you cleaning the car? Some cleaning and most wax products are bad for 
the belt. Fiero's vent grates allow such products to easily find their way onto the 
belt. It wouldn't be a bad idea to throw a cover over that side of the engine to 
prevent car wash products from getting on the belt. (Make sure the cover can't 
contact hot exhaust parts! Remove the cover as soon as you are done washing!) </p> 

<p>Check the AC compressor! If there is any missing or loose hardware, the compressor 
will move and alter the pulley alignment. Any alignment error will greatly shorten belt 
life but it is even worse with a high load item like the AC.</p>

<p>The belt's life will be affected by 
the high heat in the engine bay. Depending on the setup of the vent grates, and a few 
other things, the belt may not last more than a year or two even if everything else is perfect. 
My experience, even with Fiero's hot engine bay, is that the belts will last several years 
unless the pulleys have problems.
</p>
<h2>Checking Belt Tension</h2>
<p>This works for most spring tensioners
and will check your belt length as well without measuring anything.</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
 <li>On the
     big round end of the arm where the pivot and spring are, there is a small
     arrow. It is hard to see and is often just a small triangle.</li>
 <li>On the
     arm mount, there is a gauge area. This often looks like V*******V or it
     may be a simple raised/indented bar on the metal. It can be hard to make out too. </li>
<li><b>You do not want to see scale at top end or bottom end.</b> You want a belt near middle of the Scale. (Middle Arrow in pictule below.)</li> 
<li>When you install a belt, the Belt should slip on easily.</li>
</ul>

<p><img align="left" src="serpent/idleindex.jpg" title="Tensioner Gage" alt="Tensioner Gage">
Both marks are usually on the top part of the tensioner's pivot area and
shouldn't be hard to find once you clean the dirt off. The image left shows the actual 
scale on an 87-88 Fiero L4 tensioner assembly. A new belt should have the pointer on/between 
the closer marks. (These marks will be slightly toward the front of the car on top of the tension assembly. 
The bolt hole you see is by the water pump.)</p>

<p>The pointer on the arm must be within the gauge area on the bracket. If the
pointer is not in that area, the belt is not at the right tension and probably
will not last long. Ideally the pointer should be in the middle of the gauge.
If it is right at the low limit, the left end of the scale in the image, then it will probably move out 
of range as soon as the belt wears in some. Frankly If the belt is even close to the low limit, you want to replace 
it. Either it is very worn or significantly too long.</p>


<h2>This belt doesn't fit, the Catalog must be wrong...</h2>

<p>If you can't get the catalog belts on a car with a spring tension setup, you
could have a few things besides a wrong belt. For the 87+ Fiery L4 here are
some of the most common listings:</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
 <li>Fiero
     2.5L with AC: K060660 (Gates) 660K6 (Drive-Rite) 5060660 (Dayco) 4060660
     (Goodyear)</li>
 <li>Fiero
     2.5L no AC: K060615 (Gates) 610K6 (Drive-Rite) 5060610 (Dayco) 4060615
     (Goodyear)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Gates Goodyear and Dayco numbers are direct from their online catalogs.
Drive-Rite, a Dayco brand, is from PartsAmerica.com Oddly the Drive-Rite and
Dayco cross references to Gates K060612, which is .29 inch shorter than
K060615.</p>

<p>There is some tolerance in the system for variations in length. As long as
the tensioner stays in the proper range, it doesn't matter if one catalog says
a hair longer/shorter than another. If you put a belt on that is at the bottom
limit new, it could get out of spec once it runs in so make sure you check it after 
a few hours running. </p>

<p class="warn">Warning: The belt should easily slip onto the Idler Pulley on the Tension Assembly.</p>
<p>You should never have to fight a belt onto the idler. (Or whatever pulley goes last on other engines.)
At the same time when you let off the idler, the idler should keep it tight. (Duh.) The range of acceptable 
belts is fairly small.</p>

<p>If the listed belts won't fit, the first thing to check is the number
printed on the belt. It's not uncommon to have the belts get in the wrong
package. The sleeve packing many companies use can fall off and sometimes the
parts store or distributor puts the wrong belt back in the thing.</p>

<p>If you got the listed belt ok then you could have a bad belt tension device.
These often bind up with age and you may not be able to move them far enough to
mount the belt. Don't use a longer belt to get around this. The longer belt
probably won't be tight enough and could fail really fast. Go by the scale on the tension assembly! 
If the pointer is off scale the belt is too short regardless of catalog listing.</p>

<p>You could also have a replacement alternator or other device with the wrong
size pulley. This is very common and why you need to check the pulleys on
replacement parts. A small change in any one pulley can result in a belt change
of an inch or more depending on the pulley size and how much belt wrap it has.
If a pulley has changed, it could cause you other problems. If the alternator
is spinning too fast or slow there can be trouble. (Read Watt Story for more on that.)</p>

<p>There is some variation between how belts sit on the pulleys. This can be from one brand/type to 
another or even from one batch to another.</p>

<p>You may also suffer from "tolerance stacking." In this case slight variations in mounting of the driven devices can require a 
slightly longer or shorter belt on the system. The alternator, AC compressor, waterpump and so on have some slop in their mounts. 
Over time and various parts replacements these parts may be in slightly different locations than original. These changes can add up in 
ways that make the belt path longer or shorter than the vehicle maker called for. The catalogs all list only what the vehicle maker said fits.


<h3>How serious is correct belt fit?</h3>
<p>If you want to avoid this...<p/>

<img src="serpent/idlebash.jpg" title="Tensioner Crash" alt="Tensioner Crash">

<p>Make bloody sure that the tension assembly's pointer is on the scale. Most if not all 
tension assemblies will not tolerate being pulled over range. If the pointer goes off scale low, the 
belt can go completely slack and be thrown from the engine.

<p>To be more annoying... You won't know until you try a given belt. There is enough variation that a 66 inch belt 
from one maker will sit a little differently and be ok while another doesn't fit. Belt route will also be a factor. 
Bypassing the AC on the Fiero L4 can make it so all the 61 inch belts fit even when you have problems with some 66 inch belts.</p>

<h3>How do I read a belt size?</h3>

<p>The last or first three digits of the belt size tell you how long it is in inches and tenths. A 660K6 or x060660 
(x varies by brand/type and isn't very important.) is 66.0 inches long. The next two sizes larger are 665 and 670. 66.5 and 67.0 inches. 
(In my case the 670 belt has the pointer just a hair above the "middle" mark on the scale.)</p>

<p>An important note... The sizes that end in 5 are not always exactly .5 inch. Dayco 5060665 is actually 66.6 inches according to 
Dayco. That means you need to check belt specifications.</p>

<h2>87-88 2.5</h2>
<p>As many of you may have noticed the serpent belt setup used 
in the 87-88 4 cylinder cars is not well covered in the Haynes or Chilton's 
books. (At least not that I've ever found it.) The belt is easy to deal with as 
long as you keep a few things in mind.</p>

<p>The Fiero 4 cylinder Serpent belt requires no adjustment. Belt tension is 
controlled by a spring-loaded arm.</p>

<p>The one tool you should have is a &quot;serpent belt wrench.&quot; You 
can do without this tool but it usually means yanking the battery to get enough 
room to rotate a socket wrench. The belt wrench is made to fit into the confined 
space in Fiero and other such cramped cars. It's worth the extra cash. ($15-30 
US, shop around.) These are cheap enough that you can bend them for a custom fit 
to a given car, tho I think you will have to heat them to bend them.</p>

<p>To unload the belt tensioning arm put a 15mm wrench on the 
Idler Pulley bolt and rotate the wrench toward the battery. NEVER attempt to 
remove or rotate the bolt in the center of the spring arm!</p>


<h3>Belt Map</h3>
<p>For those people that don't have the belt map on the deck lid...</p>
<img src="misc/beltmap.gif" hspace="50" width="331" height="252" title="Belt Map" alt="belt map">

<h3>What does it mean when my tensioner is Bad or it can be Fix?</h3>

<p>Tensioner has 2 problem.... (Beside above.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Tensioner arm is bad. Meaning tensioner arm's pivot is worn out. 
(Arm pivot has an Allen bolt. <b>Do not take it apart!</b>) Buy a new tensioner. GM Part Number is 10041248.</li>
<li>Idle pulley bearing is bad. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181121/http://www.rodneydickman.com/" target="_blank">Rodney Dickmans</a> 
has bearing and cost $10.</li>
</ol>
<p>Bearing noise can be also alt, water pump, or if you have it... AC pump. </p>
<p>AC pump can pump or pulley. Noise stop when AC pump is on then clutch pulley is bad. 
Noise on when AC in on then bad pump or something is loose.</p>

<h3>Tension Assembly Replacement</h3>

<p class="warn">Replacement assemblies should come with a gasket on the engine side. 
If the gasket is missing, you will have to make one. The gasket needs to be 3/32 inch thick. 
<b>RTV Silicone WILL NOT work in this application!</b></p>

<p><img src="serpent/tensioner-gasket.jpg" title="Tensioner Gasket path" alt="Tensioner Gasket path"></p>

<ol>
<li>Drain the cooling system. (The arm unit forms a cover on the front of the water 
jacket.) </li>
<li>Disconnect the battery and remove it.</li>
<li>Remove the top alternator bolt. (You may want to loosen the bottom one, the new 
tensioner may not line up exactly.)</li>
<li>Remove the Idler Pulley from the old and new tension assemblies.</li>
<li>Remove the old tension assembly and install the new one.</li>
<li>Replace the Idler Pulley on the new Tension Assembly.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the new arm comes with a cork gasket then paint the 
gasket with Permatex High Tack, Permatex Super 300, or Balkamp Aviation sealer. 
This will fill any pours in the cork. A VERY THIN film of RTV Silicone will work if that 
is all you have handy. Make sure the whole area of the block covered by the arm 
base is clean before installing the new arm. If you pinch something between the 
arm and block you will likely damage the new arm or prevent it from sealing.</p>

<p>The new arm provided by Pontiac is built a little better than 
the original one. You should only have to replace the part once in the life of 
the engine. (Keep in mind, because this arm is a cover on the water jacket it is 
exposed to full operational heat of the coolant. The old grease in the arm 
didn't hold up well, and that results in pivot wear.)</p>

<h3>Why Is There a Hole In My Block?</h3>
<p>The large hole in the 4 cylinder that is covered by the 
serpent tensioning device is the opening for the water pump when this block is 
used in other vehicles. In most FWD versions, the hole has a steel cover bolted over it. The only variation I've seen use the hole is 
the S-10 truck. (I'm not sure if S-10 is exactly the same block or not.)</p>
