<h1>My car has leaches!</h1>

<p class="warn">WARNING: If you're battery is going dead after sitting for a
couple days, LOAD TEST THE BATTERY!!! Slow discharge is a common sign of a
battery with an internal short. DO NOT continue with this article until the
battery has been tested.</p>

<h2>Check the obvious!</h2>

<p>If you have a trunk light, make sure it's off! Make sure it shuts off when
the lid is actually closed. Take out the lamp or unplug the lid switch to make
certain. It's pretty common for the
deck lid switch to get messed up and just pushing it by hand isn't always an
accurate test.</p>

<p>If you have phones, aftermarket sound, or security equipment, have the
installation rechecked. It is extremely common that aftermarket equipment is
installed wrong, even by many &quot;professionals.&quot; Just one wire connected
wrong can make the stuff kill the battery or worse. (Allot of stores will hire
almost anyone to install things in your car.)</p>

<p>Check the fuses. Blown fuses can do really weird things in many cars,
including Fiero. They shouldn't cause anything to drain the battery but check
them to be sure.</p>

<p>Unplug the cigarette lighter. Trash in the lighter socket can cause a
partial short, especially in cars like Fiero where things can easily be spilled
in it.</p>

<h2>Sniff it out</h2>

<p>Ok, so everything you can think of is off or unplugged... The radiator and
heater fans, the trunk light, the cigarette lighter, everything... You checked
aftermarket stuff very carefully. You are sure the battery is good but it's
still being sucked down.</p>

<p>Now you need an Amp meter. Decent multi meters often have a 10 amp shunt
built in. If it takes a couple days to go flat that should be enough. (You can
buy such meters easily. I think even Wal-Mart may have them. Home Depot has a
really good electrical department.)</p>

<p class="warn">Warning! DO NOT attempt to start the car during this testing.
Most shunts are not fused. If you overload it you can fry the meter!</p>

<p>Configure the meter to run the 10-amp shunt. This is usually marked right on
the meter. If you aren't sure, get help or you will fry the meter.</p>

<p>Disconnect the ground from the battery. Connect the meter between the
battery and cable. This may be easier if you go to Radio Shack or someplace and
get some big alligator clips. You can use them to hold the probes tight to the
battery cable. You can use the terminal bolt to hold the probe against the
battery easier.</p>

<p>Have someone sit in the car with the doors closed and pull fuses one at a
time until the load drops. If you are doing this by yourself, make sure you
close the door after pulling each fuse! Otherwise you will read the courtesy
lights on the meter.... </p>

<p>Keep in mind the ECM and radio normally draw power with the car off. Those
loads should hardly show on the 10-amp scale.... Jelly2m8 says, &quot;You
should have no more than 250 ma (milliamps) with just the ECM and radio memory
draw.&quot; </p>

<h2>Pulling fuses didn't work</h2>

<p>Check headlight motors! Gen 1, 1984-86, motors are commons die. </p>

<p>If that doesn't find it, then things get harder. You'll have to mess with
the alternator, starter, and lighting.</p>

<p>The quickest way I can think of to isolate this is as follows....</p>

<p>Disconnect the single terminal connector for the ECM memory feed. This
connector looks just like the O<sub>2</sub> sensor one and is right near C500
in most Fiero. If the load is gone the ECM or more likely it's wiring is bad.
(Don't forget the ECM normally draws a little bit of power! It should hardly
register on a 10-amp meter scale.) Leave the connector apart for now.</p>

<p class="warn">WARNING! Use extreme care during the following steps. It is very
easy to cause a short. Before using a wrench, unclip the meter from the
battery.</p>

<p>Disconnect Fusible Links A and B from the small terminal of the main
junction under C500. If the load disappears then the problem is still in the
car someplace. Check the radiator fan, heater blower, and headlight systems
very carefully. These systems all feed directly from the fuse links for some or
all their functions. If that didn't find it then leave them off for now.</p>

<p>If the load is still present, disconnect the battery from the large terminal
of the junction block. <b>DO NOT</b> let the battery lead contact the body! If
the load is still there then the starter is bad. If the load is gone then the
alternator is bad.</p>
