<h1>Stop That! </h1>

<h2>The Fiero Brake System</h2>

<p>There has been a huge amount of stuff in the forum
concerning Fiero brakes. This article will explore the existing OE brakes and
&quot;upgrade&quot; issues in more detail than most consumer or shop service books. I'll
try to keep this a plane English as I can. (This is a very long document. Many
people may find it easier to print it rather than read online.)</p>

<p class="warn"><span style="color:red">Warning! This document may not contain all
the data you need to alter OE systems. The Reader assumes ALL Risk and
Liability of installing, testing, and operating cars modified using this
information. The Ogre does not endorse any method of brake system modification! 
</span></p>

<p class="note">NOTE! The Fiero Store sells a &quot;big bore&quot; master cylinder (Blazer MC). 
Increasing the MC bore 
diameter REDUCES fluid pressure. It will always make the brakes
weaker not stronger! When installed on an otherwise stock Fiero it will seriously
reduce brake system performance. You DO NOT want this thing on a stock Fiero! (See alt  MC below.)</p>

<p>Note that this article is written for the 84-87 Fiero. The
data can be altered to work for the 88 Fiero or any other car you are planing
to convert. </p>

<p>Drawings presented in this article ARE NOT TO SCALE!</p>

<h2>Erratum</h2>

<p>This page and my PPF posts were basic on the &quot;fact&quot; that Rear
Caliper using a 45mm piston. This data was from an old source from 2001 and
back then Wagner and Raybestos catalogs were unavailable online. The correct Rear
Piston is 48mm diameter and will affect the Excel sheet I use and linked below.
That Excel sheet was fixed 2/17/11. Thank to PerKr in forum for error note.</p>

<p>Switch 45 -&gt; 48mm does matter some and means the Bias calculation is bit off.
It means:</p>

<ol style="margin-top:0in" start="1" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Bias isn't main problem using 4 wheel GA upgrade. Switch
     Rear OE piston diameter makes Bias issue even less so. <span style="font-weight:bold;">But!</span></li>
 <ol style="margin-top:0in" start="1" type="a">
  <li class="MsoNormal">Using GA and any other Front caliper in back is <span style="font-style:italic;">Illegal</span>
      in U.S. and other countries and for this fact alone I'll never recommend
      it to anyone for street use.</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">Bias issue aside, using GA in front still has mechanical problem
      coved below and in PFF.</li>
 </ol>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Using GA Front, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181138/http://www.fiero.nl/forum/Forum2/HTML/083566.html" target="_blank">Seville Rear</a>, and
     Blazer MC, will be Bias to front more than I figured but not enough to
     negate the upgrade as an option. If you are going to use any upgrade path
     then this option is better to be street legal.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">And no, you can't use GA or Seville calipers on rear and
     using OE front. This will cause rear bias and is not safe. Adding prop valve just hides the problem when the work.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why did you write all this?</h2>

<p>I was originally looking at the &quot;Grand Am&quot; brake upgrade
for my own car but the more I looked into it the more questions I had. I found
a number of major safety concerns that were not addressed. I also found a
number of legal issues that no one even mentioned.</p>

<p>While digging for data I found many people installing the
GA upgrade that had no idea what kind of problems they might be getting into. I
also saw more than a few comments from people who are not happy with the
results.</p>

<p>When I started digging into the operation of the OE
system, and comparing it to the &quot;upgrade&quot;, I was amazed at the number of
mechanical and hydraulic issues that no one had taken into account.</p>

<p>This started by doing the math on the hydraulics, which exposed some very scary problems. 
When you add in the machining problems to make the front end except the GA parts, the project 
becomes much more complicated than any of the articles I've found on the net are telling us. No one 
should be doing the upgrade based on the scant published instructions. You are risking your life and 
others if you do.
</p>

<p>The information here applies to all brake systems. It will
help you uncover potential problems before you replace any parts. Keep in mind
the math only provides a starting point, because we don't have all the data for
various brake pads, you won't know the final result until system is assembled.
Generally, if the hydraulic or mechanical math shows a problem, it's not going
to get better after you install parts.</p>

<h2>For comparison </h2>

<p>When talking about brake upgrades, we need something to compare to otherwise
we have a no starting point. So we need a trusted source.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Fiero Brake Spec was: (stopping distance from 60 MPH per 87 owner's
manual)</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">192' stopping distance with max load. (Max load 401 lb. per label on car.
     GVWR 3124 lb. 87 Fiero Sport)</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">187' stopping distance with light load (light means driver weighing
     approximate 150 pounds)</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">334' stopping distance using emergency service brake with partially service break
     system failure (see note)</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">302' stopping distance with brake power unit failure (brake booster failure)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: FMVSS says Parking brake not an Emergency brake. See the <a href="brakerear.htm">rear brake</a> article. </p>

<p>In 1984, the Fiero was rated for a maximum load 187' and for light load 183'
for stopping per the owner's manual. </p>

<p>The difference in it the specs? The 87 specs allows the V6 engine with
automatic transmission. The manual transmission with any engine will stop shorter
than spec. (Push brakes, push the clutch...) To keep it simple to published the
owner's manual, the specs cover only one case, the heaviest and most powerful
engine option available with automatic transmission.</p>

<p>Note that with better brake pads, shock, struts and/or tires the car will stop better than spec.</p>

<p>Now how much the Grand Am or any other upgrade will shorten the stopping
distance is anyone's guess. Why? There are too many upgrades and not enough
qualified testing. When someone says their upgrades stops better, are they comparing
to the specs above, a worn out Fiero brake system, or what? Example: Doing a
simple test like stopping, the brake pads were hot or cold? Brake pad
temperature affects braking performance considerably. Even if they did test
before and after the upgrade, was the car had bad OE brakes? Then the test
doesn't mean anything. Many owners can't tell if the Fiero brake system parts,
especially rear calipers, are good, bad, etc.</p>

<p>If Grand Am/Seville brakes don't do anything to shorten your stopping distance,
or shorten by a few feet, than why upgrade and do all that work? The vented
rotors will resist fade so racers and maybe folks living in the hill country will
like it.</p>

<h2>Are we going to cover the brake booster or the pedal hardware?</h2>

<p>While important, these parts are not easily altered.
They either work or they don't and when they don't you simply replace the
offending part. <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">I don't think you can get a larger booster in the available space
if there even is one that has the right mounting.</span></p>
<p>Altering the pedal is way
beyond the skill of most people. (Most people that do have the skill won't do
it...) <a href="brakes5.htm">Here's
some stuff about the pedal if you need it.</a> It includes the measured pedal ratio.</p>

<h3>For Larger Booster</h3>
<p class="warn">Warning: 84-86 Fiero uses a booster filter in the engine bay.
Check the filter and vac line for promblems Before you plan a booster upgrade.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181138/http://www.fiero.nl/forum/Forum2/HTML/072173.html" target="_blank">$100 brake upgrade</a>
and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181138/http://www.fiero.nl/forum/Forum2/HTML/072173-8.html#p282" target="_blank">Rodney Dickman's comments.</a></p>

<p>I don't like Booster upgrade but don't hate it. Many are comparing old booster with problems
to new bigger booster, an apple/orange comparison. Worse, Some are
comparing Fiero to other cars/trucks. Many cars have different boosters on
different engines and Many of them have different brake design and need
whatever booster. This is why Part Stores ask engine type when you only want brake parts.
Comparing to other cars is often dangerous.</p>

<p><strong>Note that a booster can &quot;die&quot; without vacuum leaks.</strong> One diaphragm
can fail and reduce brake performance. (Use Google: vacuum booster failure)
Fiero is 25+ years old and OE booster can have problem in old age. Many can try
to replace with a used booster but is possible that used one is bad too. Cars
with vacuum filter in engine (84-86 L4) can loose brake performance when the filter
is dieing.</p>

<p>A bigger booster will Increase line pressure but no-one does homework to see
want this means... Charts in $100 upgrade are for 88 but 84-87 will see similar
results.</p>
<h4>Booster &quot;Upgrades&quot; often hides Vacuum problems</h4>

<p>Let's ignore &quot;normal&quot; external vacuum leaks in the line or the
booster itself... Just changing the booster or using the bigger booster upgrade
could still hind problems.</p>

<p>Changing a booster often means changing the check valve. Many replace the
booster when they just need to spend a few dollars and replace the valve. The
valve is a well-known source of booster problems and can wear out normally. A
bad/dirty valve can cause the booster to loose vacuum when you hit the gas
pedal and booster does take time to get full vacuum after you release the gas
pedal. Many people forget that Engine Manifold Vacuum is not a Constant and
varies widely between Zero and 25 inches Hg depending on throttle angle.
(Cruise control etc have an external tank and check valve for same reason.)</p>

<p>Another Problem is that 84-86 use 3/8in and 87-88 use 1/2in vacuum hoses
pipes and fittings. Worse, 22P etc didn't cover this change and have wrong
parts listed for 87-88, like booster's Check valve. If you have problems
fitting the hose to new booster this is why. Suggested you order the correct
valve and don't reuse iffy old valves. (The correct numbers are covered in
Brake Service page.)</p>

<p>GM didn't make this change without a very good reason, So Why? Because
Diameter, Length and Bends will affect total volume moved in X amount of time.
Bending adds more turbulence and resists flow. </p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in">FWD
     and other cars have 3 Feet or often less of vacuum line to the booster.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in">Fiero
     uses around 9 Feet of line. About Three or more times what most cars have.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list .5in">Fiero
     lines have several tight radius 90&deg; bends.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are part of why people have more problems in autocross because booster
can't keep up with brake demand, especially on the small vacuum line. Bigger
Booster can &quot;solve&quot; this issue by hiding small size of vacuum line
but can have problem too just not as obvious problem to many.</p>


<h4>Can it cause line blowout in panic stop settings?</h4>

<p>Maybe. Bigger Booster adds input pressure to the MC then MC make more Line
Pressure. Problem is Fiero brake lines (hard and soft) are 25-30 years old.
At minimum, Get new rubber hose but newer SAE j1401 type hose. 
Often sold as "Pro Grade" hose assembles, like Raybestos PG Plus. Preforms better OE w/o problems for SS.<br>
See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181138/http://www.fiero.nl/forum/Forum2/HTML/129208.html" target="_blank">rubber brake lines vs stainless steel</a></p>

<h4>Will it made brake's Perform better?</h4>

<p>Likely on dry pavement but Driving in Rain or on snow/ice, dirt, etc. can be
worse. Over boosting is a problem to many. Over boost can
made brakes touchy and are very hard modulate that can cause spinout or worse
when driving in slippery conditions.</p>

<p>You might see big booster is good or whatever but depends on many things...</p>

<p>Transmission is one big one.<br>
Auto transmission will put engine load on car when stopping. At idled V6 or V8
push more load thru auto trans then iron duke. <br>
Manuals then you push the clutch and no engine load goes to wheel while
stopping.</p>


<h2><font color="red">Why isn't the mechanical math here?</font></h2>

<p><strong>Because there isn't any point.</strong> The Grand Am parts are essentially identical to OE Fiero in terms of pad size
and rotor diameter. People install Grand Am parts to gain bigger caliper pistons 
and vented rotors. The only time the mechanical math is relevant is when you change the diameter of the rotor 
and things like that. </p>


<h2>Ketchup </h2>

<p>Just to get everyone on the same page, lets start with a
block diagram of the OE brake system. </p>

<p><img width="504" height="361" src="/web/20151002181138im_/http://home.comcast.net/~fierocave/brakeu_files/image002.gif" title="Brake Block Diagram" alt="Brake Block Diagram"></p>
<p>If we look at the flow of pressure from the Driver's foot to the wheel we end
up with:</p>

<ol>
<li>The vacuum operated boost unit assists the driver in
generating mechanical pressure on the master cylinder pistons.</li>
<li>The pedal mechanical force enters a dual circuit Step Bore
Master Cylinder, also called a &quot;Quick Take-up&quot; Master Cylinder, to provide
hydraulic pressure. The Fluid reserve is attached to the top of the Master
Cylinder.</li>
<li>The balance is used to detect failure in a brake circuit.
Should one circuit have low pressure, the balance will move and activate a
warning lamp on the dash.</li>
<li>The Proportioning Valve is built into the balance block. This
valve regulates flow rate and pressure to the rear calipers. Its job is to
prevent rear brake lockup that could spin the car.</li>
<li>The calipers clamp the pads on the rotor to stop the car.</li>
</ol>

<h3>What the ____ is a Quick Take-up Master Cylinder?</h3>

<p><a href="brakes4.htm">Here's
how the MC and it's Quick Take-up valve works.</a></p>

<h2>How is hydraulic pressure and displacement determined? (Basic Hydraulics)</h2>

<p>This is where stuff gets complicated fast. Everything is
based on the area of a circle and the volume of a cylinder. Hydraulic
calculations are done using the area of the piston face not diameter. Here are
some &quot;laws&quot; of science we need to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>Math, Area of a Circle = Pi x Radius<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>Math, Volume of a cylinder = Area of the circle x
height of the cylinder</li>
<li>Physics, For every Action there is an Equal and
Opposite Reaction.</li>
<li>Hydraulics, Pressure of the Hydraulic Fluid is Always
Equal over the Entire System.</li>
<li>Hydraulics, Output Force Increases by the ratio between
the pistons while Output Motion Decreases by the same ratio.</li>
</ul>


<p>It's easier to show you an example. To keep things easy we'll
assume the ratio of input to output is 10:1. </p>

<p><img width="480" height="288" src="/web/20151002181138im_/http://home.comcast.net/~fierocave/brakeu_files/image006.gif" title="Hydraulic Pressure" alt="Hydraulic Pressure"></p>
<p>As the small piston moves down it generates 1 PSI in all direction in the blue
fluid. When it has moved down 1 inch it will displace 1 cubic inch of fluid.
Since the large piston has 10 times the area of the small piston, it delivers
10 pounds of force but because it needs 10 times the volume to move it only
moves one 10<sup>th</sup> the distance of the small piston. If we move to 100:1
ratio then the large piston delivers 100 pounds of force but only moves 0.01
inches up. (To move the 10 sq in piston up one inch, we need 10 inches of
travel in the small cylinder.)</p>

<p>If I put a second piston in my basic example, the Fluid
Volume is split between the 2 pistons, but the Fluid Pressure is always equal
over the whole system. Both pistons would push up 10 pounds but for every inch
of input travel they would move up 0.05 instead of 0.10. System Pressure is
still 1PSI. To get both pistons up 0.10 I now have to move the input 2 inches
because I doubled the moving output area of the system to a total of 20 square
inches. (Total ratio with 2 10 sqin pistons is 20:1.)</p>

<p>Now, I want all of you to completely forget about the PSI
pressure of the fluid. It doesn't matter at all for the rest of this article.
From now on, we only care about the following items:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ratio between the input (MC) piston and the output
(caliper) piston.</li>
<li>The linear force applied to or generated by a piston.</li>
<li>Clamp force in the caliper is 2 times the linear force
of the piston. (I'll explain why in a sec...)</li>
<li>The volume of fluid movement generated by or used by a
piston.</li>
</ul>

<p>Think of the hydraulics as a liquid lever. If you have a
beam that is 11 feet long and put a pivot one foot from the end, you have a
10:1 lever. If you pull down on the long arm with 1 pound the short end can
lift 10 but it doesn't go very far. The brake pedal just adds another lever in
series. If we use a 4:1 pedal: you put 1 pound into the pedal and the pedal
puts 4 pounds on the 10:1 lever. That means on the short end of the second
lever we now are lifting 40 pounds but we are getting even less distance.</p>

<p>The clamping force at the caliper is doubled because
Physics tells us that for every force there is an equal but opposite force. At
the input, the 100 pound force of your foot is pushing your butt into the seat
with an equal 100 pounds. At the caliper the shell wraps back around in front
of the piston and creates an equal strength canceling force. The total pressure
where they meet is twice what ever the piston is making. (The same rules work
for multiple pistons in a caliper. Just the calculation process changes
slightly.)</p>

<p>For those of you that just have to know what the working
PSI of the fluid is, divide the input force by the piston area in square
inches. The area is about .785sq in for the 25.4mm MC.</p>

<p>Input / .785 = Fluid PSI (Aproximate.)</p>

<p>So if you have 400 pounds of input then fluid pressure is
about 510PSI.</p>

<h2>How does this work in Fiero?</h2>

<p>The brake system is physically different but the rules are
the same. If you put bigger caliper pistons at the wheels, you get more
pressure but the volume needed to move them also increases. If the increase is
more than the MC can deliver, you have a major problem. This is why you start
running into problems when using the Grand AM calipers.</p>

<p>Based on the table above, compared to the OE Fiero front caliper
the Grand Am caliper needs 666.018 cubic mm more volume per mm traveled. The GA
caliper uses 961.328 cubic mm more fluid than the OE rear per mm traveled. In
addition, those numbers are for just one caliper. The actual need is twice that
since there are two calipers involved on each circuit. </p>

<p>What this means is that on the front circuit, the MC
piston must move 2.629mm more to make up the extra volume. This is an important
issue because the Secondary MC piston only has a few mm of useful travel to begin
with. If there is even the smallest loss of fluid then it is extremely easy to
bottom out the Secondary piston. Once a piston hits bottom, that's it. If the
caliper hasn't reached effective operating pressure, it's not going to and you
aren't going to be able to stop. </p>

<p>The situation is even worse when both the front and rear
are converted to GA calipers. Using these calipers on both axles will likely
squeeze the Quick Take-up bore dry just trying to engage the pads. At the very
least, you develop a huge pedal travel before the brakes start to grab.</p>

<h2>What about the bigger MC?</h2>

<p>I haven't forgotten it. We'll get to that later. First I
want to talk about the calipers and other things a bit.</p>

<h2>Calipers &amp; Rotors</h2>

<p>One of the things you may have noticed in the above table
is that the OE rear caliper piston is smaller than the front one.
This is not only normal but also desirable.
We don't need as much brake on the rear axle as the front. In most cars not
only is the piston smaller but the pads and working surface of the rotor are
also reduced. No car I know of uses the same front and rear brake setup. (We'll
ignore the hand brake just now.) Fiero's use of rotors and pads that are nearly
identical on the front and rear is very unusual. </p>

<p>A common belief is that solid rotor = bad rotor design.
This is absolutely false. The choice of solid or vented rotor depends on the
application. While solid rotors are unusual on the front axle, they are common
on the rear axle of many, many, cars. Even very expensive import sports cars
often have them. Even NASCAR stock cars use solid rotors on some tracks.
Another false belief is that the solid rotor will always run too hot. Actually,
solid rotors are required in many applications in order to get the heat up
enough for the pads to work properly. Remember that most brake pads work best
in a certain temperature range.</p>

<h2>You say the word application allot.....</h2>

<p>That's because it's the single most important word there
is in a discussion about brakes. Before you can make any kind of alteration to
a brake system you must understand how the present system works and what kind
of driving it was made for. If you're talking about a street driven car then
you're looking for different kinds of things than a race only car. The vehicle
in question, the brake system, the type of use, and even the driver are all
parts of a specific application.</p>

<h2>Brake pads</h2>

<p>Choice of brake pads is the single most difficult thing to
do to a set of brakes. Most people throw any old pads on a car. This is about
the worst thing you can do. It's one of the big reasons most people think a
car's OE brakes stink. </p>

<p>Remember brake pads MUST wear in order to work. Cheap pads
could wear to fast, or worse glaze, fade, etc, because they can't handle heat
well. Rock hard pads can actually wear the rotors down.</p>

<p>I usually stay with one of the better name brand pads. The
big companies like Ferodo/Wagner, Bendix, etc, have the resources to test
things much better than most of the off brands. For a street car good name
brand pads are usually the best choice.</p>

<p>Some people have tried various carbon metallic compounds
for the pads. You have to be Very careful with these. Many of the &quot;carbomet&quot;
products are designed for race applications and they will not work properly
when cold. (Some are very dangerous when cold.)</p>

<p>Don't be afraid to try different pad sets. They aren't
that expensive. If you think your present brakes are week, try another kind of
pad. There are usually multiple types of pads from each vendor. Even a few
specialty brake pad makers have stuff for Fiero. I've never felt a need for
specialty pads but some people have used them and like them. Expect to pay a
good chunk of change for a set of these. </p>

<p>Note: Avoid pads containing Asbestos. Most pads are
Asbestos free but try to make sure.</p>


<h2>What about drilling and slotting?</h2>

<p>These are generally waste management techniques. They can also
be a weight reduction technique. They ARE NOT cooling aides.</p>

<p>On most street driven cars they will have little or no
benefit. Unless drilling and slotting are done very carefully, the rotor could
be dangerously week after machining. On race applications, drilling and
slotting are still used with carbon based pads due to the heavy dust generation
of that type of pad. Drilling is popular with drag racers because it cuts
weight.</p>

<h2>Back to &quot;upgrades&quot; of the OE hardware.</h2>

<p>Generally, it's a bad idea for most people to be changing
their OE brake system, especially based only on some scant directions off the
Internet. The &quot;Grand Am Upgrade&quot; is a perfect example of this. This upgrade has
some major issues that are not addressed well or at all.</p>

<p>One problem with this upgrade, which we mentioned above,
involves master cylinder volume. To fix this, various articles recommend using
a 28mm MC off a full size Blazer. This will fix the volume problem but can
create others. For example, if the Blazer MC is used with the OE rear brakes
then you loose allot of power from the rear calipers.</p>

<p>If we look at the math again.... </p>

<p>If you put 1 pound into the MC with the OE rear caliper,
you get 3.1 pounds out. With the Blazer MC you get only 2.5 pounds for each 1
pound in. When you are talking about hundreds to thousands of pounds of force
generated in a brake system, this is a huge pressure drop. This doesn't account
for the further loss in the proportioning valve.</p>

<p>When the Grand Am caliper is used front and rear we end up
with no bias at all except what ever is provided by the Proportioning valve.
This isn't good either in most applications. Even race only applications need
front/rear bias or the car becomes dangerously unstable. All versions of this
upgrade require resetting the system proportioning and that is a job only very
experienced brake mechanics should attempt.</p>

<h2>How much pressure are we dealing with?</h2>

<p>Well... We'll ignore the brake booster for now. We'll just
use a 4:1 pedal for an example. (I'm not crawling under the dash to measure the
thing...) (I eventually did measure the pedal when I replaced the bushings. 
It's very close to 4:1)</p>


<p>With a 4:1 pedal, 100 pounds of force from your foot
delivers 400 pounds to the MC piston. 400 pounds X 3.722 (OE front piston
ratio) = 1488.8 pounds at the face of the caliper piston. (And you wondered why
those things were so heavy....) Since the caliper shell is pushing with about
the same amount in the other direction, we have a clamping force of about
2977.6 pounds. If we threw in whatever the brake booster adds to the system,
the clamp pressure would be even higher yet. (Actual clamp pressures of 4-5
Tons are common.)</p>

<p>To use the same example on the rear</p>

<h2>I have a big motor, I need bigger brakes... I race, I need cooler brakes...</h2>

<p>You just might. I'm not saying it can't be done. The point
here is that there are allot of issues with this that most people are unaware.
There may be aftermarket systems but these are designed as full systems. If
they retain any of the OE parts, it is because they are designed to do so. (Or
at least one would hope they are for the price of them.)</p>

<p>I'm not arguing the fact Fiero OE brakes don't work well
in racing. They were never designed for that application. Keep in mind that
Fiero was never originally designed to be a sport car. It was built to be a
little econo skate to get to work and not look like the rest of the rolling
shoeboxes on the road. Notes in the Tech forum indicate the GA brake parts can
solve some race braking issues. This article is mainly targeted at the
development of street legal and safe brakes.</p>

<p>The work I've done here is a large part of why most of the
full systems are so expensive. You can't alter just one part of the system.
Every little thing effects the whole system. </p>

<p>In reality, you may NOT need bigger brakes. You may only
need different pads or some other &quot;small&quot; change. The Fiero OE brakes can handle normal driving and even some abuse. 
You can push the abuse envelope with better brake pads. (Example: ThermoQuiet from Wagner.) 
If the car develops a fade problem in heavy driving or warp rotor(s) than you'd might need an upgrade. 
Although in most driving, a warped rotor is service problem. Dragging pads from stuck pistons or sliders 
will wreck the rotors fast. So check your service issues before you do an upgrade.</p>

<p>In most cases, the only
reason to change the hardware at the wheels is racing applications that may
develop brake fade problems from overheating the parts. Some race applications
are actually hurt by installing the GA parts because of the added weight.</p>

<h2>Grand Am/Beretta brake "upgrade"</h2>

<p>While I agree there are certain problems with the OE brake
system, I don't think this brake upgrade is desirable as many people claim.
This upgrade is at best RACE ONLY. Cars equipped with the upgrade should not be
put into street service until a brake engineer has tested the car using a brake
dynamometer and other techniques.</p>

<p>If you are considering this upgrade, dig out all the facts
first. There are a number of posts in the forums by people who are not happy
with this &quot;upgrade.&quot;</p>

<p>I have examined the information and science behind this
upgrade and there are major problems. I will no longer support or advocate this
upgrade in any way. I will not do it to my own car and I don't recommend doing
it to yours. </p>

<p>The front-end only version of this upgrade cannot simply be slapped on the car.
 Recalibrating brake bias IS NOT a simple issue of installing an
adjustable valve in the lines and playing with it until it &quot;feels&quot;
right. A setting that works on dry pavement could be fatal on wet. (Most Brake
Tech's are NOT qualified for this level of work.)</p>


<h3>Other reasons behind this conclusion...</h3>

<p>There is such a tiny amount of information on this upgrade.
The information available includes none of the science behind the conversion
and no reliable test data. It simply lists parts that someone dug out of a book
or scrap yard until something was cobbled to fit.</p>

<p>The front upgrade has a number of machining issues that are
poorly addressed. Little to none of the information published addresses these
issues. I doubt any of the &quot;kits&quot; have either. </p>

<p>The front upgrade has a clearance problem with the caliper
support bracket. The usual answer is to grind material from this bracket. This
only works on the poorly refinished hub most people are using. If the hub is
worked to properly center the rotor and reduce wheel offset then even more
grinding of the bracket is required. This can leave the bracket weakened in
such a way that it could fail very suddenly during braking. The reality is that
these brackets probably need to be replaced not reworked.</p>

<p>If the hub is not reworked to account for the new rotor then
the new rotor will be off center and will vibrate. Just how bad this is depends
on just how far off center the rotor is. You may not feel it but it will
vibrate. Failure to lock the rotor on center can also result in the rotor
shifting position between the wheel and hub during braking. The only reliable
centering point on the new rotor is the center hole.</p>

<p>Unless the hub face is machined back by some or all the
thickness of the rotor hat then the wheels are pushed out by the new rotors
about one inch. That creates a number of subtle changes in wheel alignment. New
wheels used with this upgrade should have the offset recalculated to return the
tires to their correct position. (Before anyone tries to machine the face of
the hub to account for this you had better check how much metal is available to
machine off without weakening the hub.)
How much effect this has depends on the wheels and tires used and how
the car is driven.</p>

<p>The new parts add unsprung weight to the car. The Grand Am
calipers are cast iron while the Fiero OE calipers are aluminum. The new hub/rotor
set for the front is also heavier than OE. Increasing unsprung weight affects
ride quality and handling. The increase will require careful consideration when
selecting new shocks and struts.</p>

<p>Few people working on brakes actually understand how all the
parts work together. Changes made to any one part affect all other parts.</p>

<h3>Legal Problems</h3>

<p>Sales or use of the upgrade on street driven cars creates
very serious legal issues, especially if the rear axle is converted as well.
 Persons installing or selling this upgrade or cars
equipped with it need to talk to their attorneys and liability insurance
company. Any car using the upgrade that is involved in an accident is highly
likely to result in very ugly lawsuits.</p>

<p>Persons installing this upgrade &quot;because it's
cheap&quot; are only fooling themselves.
<span style="font-weight:bold;">The real cost may only show up after you're in a wreck,
are sued in Civil Court, and find your insurance is not going to pay because of
an illegal/bad conversion.</span>
Even if insurance pays, the maximum pay out is in your policy.
Lawsuits can/will ask for more money, especially when they find out you "upgraded" the brake etc.</p>
<h4>FMVSS</h4>
<p>Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) is starting point. Rules how
new cars and many mod/upgrade are design for.
NHTSA (USDOT) has ordered many recalls for aftermarket parts/"upgrade" that don't meet FMVSS rules.</p>
<p>Correction: I believe Fiero was actually built to standard 571.105, instead of 571.135 as I originally had here.
 The hand brake was required in that standard as well but the testing is a little
different.</p>

<p>Federal Regulations covering brake systems are very specific and are defined in: </p>
<p class="quote">Code of Federal Regulations<br>
Title 49--Transportation<br>
Chapter V--National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Department Of Transportation<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181138/http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_00/49cfr571_00.html" target="_blank">
Part 571--Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards--Table of Contents</a><br>
Subpart B--Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards<br>
Sec. 571.105  Standard No. 105; Hydraulic and electric brake systems.</p>

<p>The standard defines the entire automotive brake system and the testing requirements. 
Vehicles that do not meet these standards are considered legally inoperative. There are huge fines and other penalties for shops that intentionally disable required systems such as the hand brake.

<p class="quote">S5.2 <span style="font-style:italic;">Parking brake system.</span> Each vehicle with a GVWR of 10,000
lbs. or less and each school bus with a GVWR greater than 10,000 lbs., shall be
manufactured with a parking brake system of a friction type with a solely
mechanical means to retain engagement, which shall under the conditions of S6.,
when tested according to the procedures specified in S7., meet the requirements
specified in S5.2.1, S5.2.2, or S5.2.3 as appropriate, with the system engaged-</p>
<p class="quote">(a) In the case of a vehicle with a GVWR of 10,000 lbs. or less,
with a force applied to the control not to exceed 125 pounds for a
foot-operated system and 90 pounds for a hand-operated system;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="font-style:italic;">It's not illegal, at least federally, to improve the brake system as long as the 
system still meets FMVSS requirements.</span></span> 
The 4 wheel Grand Am upgrade clearly does not meet these standards and is illegal 
for street use in the U.S. because it eliminates the parking brake. 
The front only upgrade would also be illegal if the car can't 
pass all the tests in the required standard.</p>
<h4>How does this applies to State Laws?</h4>
<p>States maybe write laws/rules/regulations that are much different that
FMVSS, based on FMVSS, even copy FMVSS. You needs to read your State rules.</p>
<p class="note">You need to check State's law and DOT/DMV rules/regulations.
In some States, DOT regulates what is street legal or not similar to NHTSA and FVMSS regulations.
Others have that info in the state's laws.</p>
<p>If legal locally, drive in another state then that state laws can apply to you when driving there.
Could be big problems after a wreck in another state.</p>
<h4>But it passed inspection... I don't have inspections... </h4>
<p>Many states don't have inspections or have inspections that don't test the parking brake. 
Just because you can get by a State inspection doesn't make it street legal. 
You can still face criminal and civil penalties for upgrades that don't meet Federal/State standards.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Examples:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Delaware Inspection doesn't look at parking brakes but DE Rules
says: Parking or Emergency Brake - Must stop vehicle within a distance of 54
feet from a speed of 20 miles per hour. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181138/http://www.dmv.de.gov/services/vehicle_services/v_equipment.shtml" target="_blank">dmv.de.gov vehicle equipment</a>)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Delaware and some others, Inspection does look at normal
brakes but uses skid type dyno for inspection. This
type uses 4 skid pads you drive on and stop. Screen shows results on each
wheel. If Screen shows Weak/no brakes on 1 wheel/axle = inspection fails. 
Official DE Rules? Foot Brake - Must stop vehicle within
distance of 20 feet from a speed of 20 miles per hour on dry pavement. Brakes
must be adjusted to work evenly on opposite sides of vehicle. (Same page as
above)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">NY Inspection shops look under the car and even take off
wheels looking for brake issues. Worn/Dead/Missing brake parts = inspection
fails.</p>


<h3>Can I use &quot;Line Locks&quot; as a Parking Brake?</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">No.</span> These items use Hydraulic pressure to hold your car. </p><p>Why:</p>
<ul>
<li>All Line Locks are NOT street legal for a parking brake. See FMVSS 571.105 above.</li>
<li>Line Locks are made for Temporary Use with the Driver in the car.</li>
<li>Extended use of Line Locks can leak down and cause leaks in the calipers. 
Brake seals are not made for constant pressure that Line Locks uses.
Extended Use mean more than a few minutes of use. 10-30 minutes and many brake systems have trouble keeping pressure up. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Where did this brake upgrade come from?</h3>

<p>As best I can tell, it was developed by a race project. In
that application, the upgrade has definite advantages over the OE solid rotors.
(There is one post in the Tech forum that verifies the thermal advantage.) </p>

<p>There is no evidence on any of the sites touting the upgrade
that it has been properly tested for street use. </p>

<h3>Are there solutions for the mechanical problems?</h3>

<p>It may be possible to address the mechanical problems but it won't be
half as cheap or easy as many people claim. Fixing the problems for the front
axle is mainly an issue for a machinist. It will likely require a new bracket
for the caliper and/or a new hub. The rear axle version of this upgrade can
never be made legal for street use.</p>

<p>I think a big issue is that the GA rotor needs to be
replaced with one just like it but having a shorter &quot;hat.&quot; This would
allow the hub to be better machined and avoid clearance problems with the
bracket and stone shield. From what I can see, the alternate hat looks to be
between 1/4 to 1/2 inch shorter. I don't have all the data needed to get an
accurate number at this time.</p>

<p>Or maybe &quot;Concentric Rings&quot; like Bloozeberry uses on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181138/http://www.fiero.nl/forum/Forum3/HTML/000116-9.html#p324" target="_blank">Corvette
rotor upgrade</a>? Bloozeberry note is an example. GA needs different rings. Source of rings? Don't know. 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181138/http://www.fiero.nl/forum/Archives/Archive-000001/HTML/20130314-2-119307.html" target="_blank">In this thread</a> I posted dimensions to make/buy them. But
then you still have the problem to center the wheel... You can try use &quot;Lug
Centric&quot; method. In Lug Centric method: </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Need Cone lugs (Turner lugs and Lugs w/ washer might not work.)</li>
<li>Wheel must not see any load while mounting</li>
<li>Torque lugs by hand using a torque wrench</li>
</ul> 
<p>At minimum, all lugs hand
tight in star pattern, torque 50ft/lb in star pattern, then torque to spec in
star pattern. (Usually around 100ft/lb for alloy wheels.)</p>

<p>Another item commonly sited is that the GA rotor is
vented. A problem with that is the rotor is presently installed so close to the
stone shield that the air flow is mostly blocked. I'm sure there is some flow
but I doubt it's as much as many people think. Fixing this involves altering or
replacing the OE stone shield.</p>

<h3>Another option...</h3>
<p><strong>No, I still don't recommend this method either because of mechanical problem above.</strong>
At least this method has the parking brake.</p>
<p>To use GA front, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181138/http://www.fiero.nl/forum/Archives/Archive-000001/HTML/20130314-2-083566.html" target="_blank">Seville Rear</a>, and Blazer MC. </p>
<p>This method mainly gives you vented rotors, <span style="font-style:italic;">saves parking brake</span>, 
Maybe a very small Hydraulic advantage, but not much else. Front GA has same problem as always...  
The Excel sheet below has been updated to reflect rear caliper change.</p>

<h3>Does anyone make a &quot;good&quot; version of the Grand Am upgrade? Even just for
the front?</h3>

<p>Not that I've seen. All the &quot;kits&quot; I can get any details
on have been created by simply following the instructions available online. The
comments made by several people who've purchased the kit versions tend to back
this up. A number of comments indicate the people wishing they had not done the
upgrade either by kit or on their own. I believe it is possible to create a
better kit but it's very unlikely to happen. There is much more involved here
than simply chopping down the OE hub/rotor to fit the GA rotor to it. I doubt
there is enough demand to justify the development cost.</p>
<h3>Can I Keep OE MC with Front GA &quot;upgrade?&quot;</h3>

<p>Some have kept the OE MC and rear brakes and
upgraded only the fronts, <strong>But...</strong></p>

<p>First, you need to carefully understand how <a href="brakes4.htm">Quick
Take-up Master Cylinder</a> because the Quick Take-up feature can hide problems.</p>

<p>Then read or reread &quot;How does this work in Fiero?&quot; above.</p>

<p>Two big problems:</p>

<ul type="disc">
 <li>Some to
     most owners with this setup have run out of fluid flow from the Secondary
     MC piston. Running out of fluid flow stopped any more pressure generated from
     the MC. Big GA caliper piston and Quick Take-up Master Cylinder hides this
     problem in normal driving.</li>
 <li>If you do
     not hit the Secondary MC piston that limits travel now then you have
     nothing left as reserve if/when later you have clearance issues or have
     minor seal problem with GA front brake.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Can you test this problem with Brake Pressure Gauges?</h4>

<p>Not really. Problem is that Normal gauges need some fluid flow and likely voids
the test. Example: Most gauges have air inside and very hard to purge/bleed the tube.

<h3>Can I use GA or Seville to upgrade the rear brakes only?</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">No...</span> Using GA, or Seville, for a Rear Only "upgrade" = BAD idea.
Wishful Thinking doesn't make a bad idea good. Internet has allot of bad ideas.</p>

<h4>Why a bad idea?</h4>

<p>Using bigger rear brakes will upset the car's Brake Bias (OE or bigger MC doesn't matter.) and can causing the car to spin,
depending on road condition <i>or not.</i> Bad Brake Bias in a car can cause spin-out even on Dry pavement.
After you spin then you hope you hit nothing, other Drivers don't hit you, etc. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181138/http://www.fiero.nl/cgi-bin/fiero/showThread.cgi?forum=Archive-000003&amp;thread=20120111-6-079504" target="_blank" title="Argument : Why is the Grand Am brake upgrade bad?">this thread</a>
in Totally O/T. For Bias math, <a href="brake_math.zip">
download the Excel sheet.</a> </p>

<h4>I can use a new Prop Valve...</h4>

<p><strong>No</strong>, covered in the same thread above. A valve set wrong or fails and have a bit of rain then easy to spin out. 
Aftermarket prop valves can fail with no warning.</p>


<h2>What about a different Master Cylinder?</h2>
<p>(Upgrade MC with OE calipers.)</p>
<p class="warn">No-one is looking at alternate MC anymore... 
Some test said alt MC can't move enough Fluid and give no reserve capacity. 
Using a Blazer MC with OE calipers will make brakes weaker, not stronger. Look elsewhere.</p>

<p>One thing no one seems to have noticed is that an OE Grand
Am install actually has a smaller MC than Fiero. This should raise a bunch of
questions by itself. (OE Grand Am is 24mm main bore.) </p>

<p>One reason we can't use the Grand Am MC is that, like all
other GM front wheel drive cars, the Grand Am has cross fed brakes with one
front and one rear wheel on each circuit. Fiero has front on one circuit and
rear on the other. In addition, the Grand Am is rear drum. Drum slave cylinders
don't use as much volume as disks. So you likely can't easily convert a GA to 4
wheel disk and keep the original MC. The reason the MC in the GA works is
because only one front caliper is on each MC piston. The GA MC will not work if
you try to put both calipers on the same circuit.</p>

<p class="note">The Fiero Store sells a &quot;big bore&quot; master cylinder (Blazer MC). 
Increasing the MC bore 
diameter REDUCES fluid pressure. It will always make the brakes
weaker not stronger! When installed on an otherwise stock Fiero it will seriously
reduce brake system performance. You DO NOT want this thing on a stock Fiero!</p>

<p>The purpose of the large bore is to increase fluid volume. The
large MC is needed to make up for the vastly increased fluid demand of the
larger caliper pistons. In this setting the stock
MC can never deliver the volume of fluid needed.</p>


<p class="note">The rest of this section has been removed. Reason: Out Of Date and Cannot be made safe. 
Even for racing, its a bad idea. I will not answer any questions on this subject. </p>

<h2>How can I get more volume from the OE MC?</h2>

<p class="warn">Warning! <font color="red">This section is out of date.</font><br>
You must keep the rears properly adjusted if you do this <span style="font-style:italic;">but</span>
you won't have the reserve capacity to make up for sloppy pad clearance. 
The Problem is that the rear calipers will never stay in adjustment most of the time. 
<span style="font-style:italic;"><font color="red">This means that most people should <u>not</u> use this method.</font></span>
"Better" option, if you are going to use GA fronts then use Seville rears above.</p>

<h2>Proportioning</h2>

<p class="note">Very important note... 
Most OE prop valve, like 84-87 Fiero uses, doesn't work in most stopping, only use in panic stop settings. 
Most people think all bias is done by a valve but their wrong most times. 
Prop valve think regulator and activate until 800-900PSI from MC. Prop valve doesn't activate in normal use. 
Many other ways to give you Bias, Fiero and most GM models included. 
If only valve to give you Bias then when valve is dead, Bias is dead... and likely only warning is car gets spinning around.
</p>

<p>This is a delicate topic. A tiny change to the prop valve
can have a major effect on the brake system. To make this even more difficult,
a setting that works on dry pavement may be horrible on a slick road.</p>

<p>This isn't just an issue of adding a new prop valve in the
rear brake circuit. You may have to work on the OE valve as well. Why? Because
when you boost front brake performance, you may actually need less rear brake
restriction than the OE valve is set for, not more like you would have with an
added valve.</p>

<p>The preferred way to change proportioning is to recalibrate 
the existing valve. This will keep the safety bypass in 
the balance block operational. 
</p>

<p>If you do use a new valve, make sure it is a high quality part. This is
one of those devices where you get what you pay for. Keep in mind that 
a new valve will eliminate the safety bypass feature of the 
balance block. This means you won't get full power at the rear 
wheels if the front brakes fail. </p>

<p>When you do install another valve, the the new valve must be
<u>after</u> the balance block. The MC must always have a clear run to the
block or you will have the brake light on. To give the best results a new prop
valve may require gutting/altering the OE valve. This will usually happen when
you want to run some prop valve but not as much as OE. (Leave the Balance
portion of the block alone!)</p>

<p>The final setting is going to vary according to each
driver's needs and the specific configuration of the car. I can't tell you just
how to set this. What ever you decide on, the rear brakes <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">must not</span> lock before the front. </p>

<h4>But my rear brakes won't lock up. GM setup for Prop valve must be wrong.</h4>

<p>No. <a href="brakerear.htm#rearlockup">See rear brakes for more info.</a></p>

<h2>TEST, TEST, and Test some more...</h2>

<p><span style="font-style:italic;">You can't over test
a change to the brake system!!!</span> Your life and many other people's depend on
fully testing the system. This isn't a simple matter of driving along and
slamming on the brakes, although you do have to do that... You have to test it
on dry and wet conditions. You have to test in turns, on slick areas, and even
different kinds of pavement. Testing on dirt isn't a bad idea either. Driving
on loose dirt isn't much different from snow and ice.</p>

<p>One tool you may want to get for this work is a pressure
gauge for the brakes. This will let you get the actual pressure in the front
and rear circuits. Wilwood has a one. You could probably make one if you can
find a suitable gauge. I imagine the hard part is figuring out how to get rid
of air in the gauge.</p>

<p>If you get lucky, you can talk someone into letting you
run it over a brake dyno. <span style="font-style:italic;">What in hell is
that?</span> It looks like a vehicle scale with 4 separate top sections. You drive
onto it and hit the brakes. The pads feed up to a measuring station that tells
you what each wheel is doing during an actual stop. (Delaware uses these during
vehicle inspection. I love them. If you fail, you know right quick where to
start looking for the problem.) If your brake balance is way off front to rear,
this thing can tell you right away.</p>
