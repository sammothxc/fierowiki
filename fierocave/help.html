<h1>Help!</h1>

<p>This page should cover the few things that people have sent me email
about...</p>

<h2>No Java Here</h2>

<p>I've removed Java menu because I'm tired of Oracle's Java Security and Patching. Java has one &quot;0-day&quot; problem after another. (Just search tech news, like C-net news.) Windows and Mac owners, If you use Java only to access my site then <span style="font-weight:bold">Please uninstall Java now.</span></p>

<h2>Java Script support is now an option to use this site.</h2>
<p>Java Script is use by
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181145/http://users.tpg.com.au/j_birch/plugins/superfish/" target="_blank">Superfish</a>
menu and Combination Valve page. The menu does works but will break text size feature w/o it.</p>

<h2>Can't find _____?</h2>
<p>Try <a href="map.htm">Site Map.</a> This page has <strong>all</strong> Fiero Cave pages. <span style="font-style:italic;">New articles will show up here first!</span>
</p>
<p>Site Map icon is: <img src="css/map.png" alt="Site Map" title="Site Map" style="vertical-align : text-top;
"></p>
<h2>Does your site support "Smart" Phones and small Tablets?</h2>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>If the device's browser uses CSS Media="handheld" or Display Width &lt; 800 pixels then site sets:</p>
<p>Use bigger font size buttons<br>
Removed background &amp; bullet list images<br>
Hides Menu, use Site Map to brows more pages.
</p>

<h2>Some links will not open.</h2>

<p>Note that external links listed on most cave pages open in new windows.
(popups) If the links don't work it may be because you have popup blocking
turned on. You will need to adjust your popup blocking settings to allow these
links to work. (There are no advertising popups anywhere in the Ogre's Cave.)</p>

<h2>Page Formatting</h2>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, Cable and DSL connections are not available in
many areas, even heavily populated ones. I've done about everything I can to
save both server space and download bandwidth. None of these items should choke
current browsers. </p>

<h3>CSS</h3>

<p>The Cave is formatted with Cascading Style Sheets. All current browsers
should support CSS. There is little if any IE specific CSS.</p>

<p>If you are using an older browser, get a new one. If you don't like IE, try <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181145/http://www.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>.</p>

<h3>Fonts</h3>

<p>The Cave uses &quot;Trebuchet MS&quot; font on systems that have it. Most Windoze
machines with MS Office, and/or IE 4 &amp; up, have this font. </p>

<p>Macintosh users with MS office or MS IE may also have this font. (I don't
know for sure what is in Office/IE for Mac.)</p>
<p>In all other cases, it should render with Helvetica/Ariel headings and Times
body text. Those are the only fonts I know of that are common to nearly all
operating systems. They look crappy but everyone has them.</p>
<p>The site supports Open Dyslexia fonts, see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181145/http://dyslexicfonts.com/" target="_blank">Open-Dyslexic</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181145/http://fierocave.home.comcast.net/OpenDyslexic-ttf.zip" target="_blank">download here</a>.</p>
<p>Text Zoom only zooms main text. Currently set for 90%, Normal, 175%, 250% and Will Not affect printing a page.</p>

<h3>Images, Why the Watermark?</h3>

<p>Most Images and Diagrams now have the &quot;Watermark&quot; below. Why? Because some
&quot;Businesses&quot; steal my work. This is one way to mess with that plan in
future. </p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
 <li>Can I post images and diagrams in PFF and other Forums?
     That's fine with me. </li>
 <li>Site still supports the concept of Fair Use? Yes. Many
     authors in past (some ask, Thank you.) can use pages, images, etc, in
     non-commercial use. What burns me is some Businesses use my pages as their
     own work...</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Please Note:</span></p>
<p>As of August 2012... I have
removed all the Vector images. Now using only have GIF and JPG.</p>
