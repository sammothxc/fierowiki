<h1>Quick Take-up Master Cylinder</h1>
<p>This master cylinder was developed by GM in the late
1970's to allow the use of &quot;low drag&quot; disk brake calipers. The primary piston
has two different diameters. The large bore, 36mm, delivers 
low pressure, high volume, fluid to the calipers to take up the slack. When
the pressure builds up to a certain level, the main bore, 25.4mm in 84-87
Fiero, takes over and generates the actual brake pressure.</p>
<p>There is a very nice explanation and animation of how a normal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181226/http://http//auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake-types/master-brake.htm" target="_blank">master
cylinder</a> operates at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181226/http://www.howstuffworks.com/" target="_blank">How Stuff Works</a>
but I could not find a decent visual on the Quick Take-up system. Once you
understand a regular system, these slides should give you a better idea of how
fluid moves in a step bore setup. Since the function of the secondary piston is
the same as a normal system I've left out most of it. I've also left out
details like return springs that aren't relevant at the moment.</p>

<h2>How &quot;Quick Take-up&quot; Works</h2>

<p>Our fist slide shows everything at rest. The QT valve is only allowing
enough fluid movement to equalize thermal expansion and contraction.</p>

<p><img border="0" width="457" height="367" src="brakes4/image001.gif" title="QT Valve at Rest" alt="QT Valve at Rest"></p>

<p>The second slide shows the take-up phase. This is what happens when you've
started to apply the brakes but haven't yet reached operating pressure in the
system. Notice the fluid flow around the small section of the primary piston.
This bypass flow is possible because the MC uses &quot;cup&quot; seals for everything but
the large seal on the Primary piston. Cup seals can only block fluid flow in
one direction. (The Secondary piston has two seals arranged &quot;bottom to
bottom.&quot; The area between its seals never sees any fluid pressure.)</p>

<p><img border="0" width="457" height="367" src="brakes4/image002.gif" title="QT Valve Holding" alt="QT Valve Holding"></p>

<p>There's allot of fluid moving during the take up phase of the cycle and it's
actually moving faster than you think. Don't forget a basic rule of fluids...
When you squeeze a fluid from a large area into a narrow area the fluid
accelerates. </p>

<p>Our next slide shows what happens when the calipers are closed against the
rotor and starting to brake the car. The QT valve is now venting pressure from
the large section of the primary piston. This leaves the small section free to
develop full brake pressure and significantly reduces brake pedal effort.</p>

<p><b>Update note:</b> The QT valve will open anytime flow is too fast for rear circuit to take fluid flow, like bleeding, etc. 
It's <u>normal</u> to see a geyser in the rear section of the reserve tank. <b>Keep the tank close when you are doing bleeding.</b>
</p>

<p><img border="0" width="457" height="367" src="brakes4/image003.gif" title="QT Valve in Exhaust Mode" alt="QT Valve in Exhaust Mode"></p>

<p>In our fourth slide the brakes have been released and are returning to rest.
The QT valve now shifts to replenish mode and allows the primary piston to draw
in fluid exhausted during the full braking portion of the cycle. It also
compensates for any fluid that doesn't return from the calipers due to wear of
the pads. (Pad wear increases caliper volume as the brakes are used.)</p>

<p><img border="0" width="457" height="367" src="brakes4/image004.gif" title="QT Valve in Refill Mode" alt="QT Valve in Refill Mode"></p>

<p>In our last slide we can see a schematic of the QT valve. I've drawn it the
way it works, not the way it looks. In the real QT valve the bleed passage that
allows the MC to equalize is cut into the face of the Blow Off valve. The check
valve is actually formed by the cup seal between the QT valve and master
cylinder.</p>

<p>The "seal" will act like a valve to refill the Primary Piston. </p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>As I mentioned above fluid accelerates when it's squeezed into a smaller
area. The result of this is the take-up phase happens faster than you are
pushing the pedal. Even better, the acceleration applies to both circuits.
Given the same hardware for the pedal and at the wheels, a step bore MC will
always close the calipers faster than a straight bore. The result of
accelerating the take-up phase is the brakes are more responsive in a system
using a Quick Take-up master cylinder.</p>

<p>Because the QT function increases available volume, we gain some flexibility
in the working bore. Since we don't have as big an issue with volume, we can
reduce the main bore diameter to gain increased working pressure. (Big piston
more volume, small piston more pressure.) More pressure available from the
master cylinder means more stopping power at the wheels. </p>

<p>Step Bore MC's will also tolerate a greater range of pad clearance in the
caliper. This means you maintain a higher pedal even with rear calipers that
have excessive pad clearance. (Excessive rear pad clearance is an epidemic in
Fiero and other GM cars. It's probably the greatest factor in under performing
4 wheel disk brakes.)</p>

<h2>It Broke!</h2>

<p>There are several ways that a Master Cylinder can fail...</p>

<p>QT valve failure. This is unique to QT MC. You have low pedal but no fluid
loss. As long as the brakes are adjusted correctly you'll have low pedal but it
will feel solid and need only normal effort. IF the brakes are too far out of
adjustment you'll likely squeeze the MC dry and have no brakes or a seriously
low pedal. At this point the brakes will behave allot like there is air in
them. You'll probably be able to pump them up but they will go flat again after
you let off for a couple seconds.</p>

<p>Secondary piston seal failure. One seal fails and exhausts fluid to the MC
tank. This has about the same effect as a ruptured line in either brake
circuit. (It is possible but rare for both seals on the secondary piston to
fail.)</p>

<p>Primary piston seal failure. The effect of this depends on which one quit.
Failure of the small one will leave the rear brakes dead. The brake pressure
will simply vent to the tank. The large seal can, and likely will, leave you
with low pedal but if the brakes are adjusted like they should be, you will
still be able to stop the car with normal pedal effort. This will last until
the fluid supply runs out at which point you'll have no brakes. Fortunately in
most cases the large seal tends to drip fluid rather than squirt large volumes.
(It is possible that both seals on the Primary piston can fail. Usually the
rear seal fails and is undetected or ignored and then the front seal lets go.)</p>

<p>There is one more common type of failure you can cause by &quot;pedal bleeding&quot;
the system. In this case you can trash the front seal of one or both pistons by
driving them into accumulated trash in the section of the MC bore that is
normally unused in a working system. The worst offender here is the front seal
on the secondary piston. It is also possible to jam the secondary piston so it
won't return. This is quite common in vehicles that have never had the fluid
changed. It's also common in rebuilt master cylinders that aren't reworked very
well. Problems of this type will ruin a Master Cylinder that seemed ok prior to
bleeding.</p>

<p>In all failure cases the MC needs to be rebuilt or replaced. Always try to
obtain new rather than rebuilt master cylinders. (See the rebuilding notes in
the main article.)</p>
<h2>Patent Notes</h2>

<p>You can search the database at the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181226/http://www.uspto.gov/" target="_blank">US Patent and Trademark Office</a> web site.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to the Patent Office's Quick Search page.</li>
<li>Enter &quot;Quick Take-up&quot; in the Term 1 box</li>
<li>Enter &quot;General Motors&quot; in the Term 2 box</li>
<li>Set &quot;Select Years&quot; to &quot;All Years&quot; </li>
<li>Leave all other boxes as they are.</li>
<li>Click search.</li>
</ol>

<p>This will return 16 documents related to the Quick Take-up
master cylinder. The one to start with is # 4,133,178. That one gives a clearer
description and has better illustration. Our version of the MC looks close to
Patent # 4,208,881. The other ones listed cover details of the installation and
different blow off valve types. (#4,213,655 has the details on cross fed brakes like
those in Grand Am and other FWD cars.)</p>

<p>To view the images you will need a compatible TIFF Viewer.
The help button on any of the database pages will point you to the one USPTO
recommends.</p>

<p>If you have problems getting the plugin to work, try
reloading it with the &quot;modify my windows registry&quot; box checked. (It wouldn't
work in IE 5.5sp1 until I did that.) Since most people don't use TIFF images
much this shouldn't be a problem.</p>

<p>I found it was easier to understand the patents once I
printed the images so I could lay out the whole thing as I read the text. The
&quot;abstract&quot; portion explains most of the thing in clear terms. The details are
handy for understanding exactly how some small part of the thing works. The
&quot;claims&quot; section is gibberish to most people.</p>

<h3>How Fiero (and others) depart from the patent schematics.</h3>
<p>The Fiero MC is very close to patent #4,208,881. A couple changes to the flow valve are important.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Flow valve does away with the extra bleed passage.</li>
<li>The blow off valve does not use a ball.</li>
</ol>

<p>Instead, the Fiero version has a cylindrical blow off valve with a small groove cut in the face. The groove serves as the bleed passage.</p>
<p>The Fiero valve is like the one in the patent in all other ways. This newer version of the valve is simpler to make than the one in the patent since the majority of parts are now simple injection mold jobs. In addition, the Fiero version is probably a little more reliable because the groove should be less prone to blockage than the one in the patent.</p>
