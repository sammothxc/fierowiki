<h1>Better Living Thru Chemicals</h1>
<p>(A DuPont trademark slash catch phrase from years ago.)</p>

<h2>How would you like your poison today?</h2>

<p>Many people have no idea how dangerous some chemical products are and could
easily be handling any poison or carcinogen know or even unknown to man. What
should you do if you spill a chemical? Get it on you? Someone or Something
consumes it? Wouldn't it be nice if there were a place you could find that
information <i>before</i> an emergency?</p>

<p>There is such a place. Actually a few...</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">While
     many people have heard of the Poison Control Center. They don't know there
     are many of these centers in the U.S. You can find your local center and
     more from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150212023858/http://www.aapcc.org/" target="_blank">The American Association of
     Poison Control Centers</a>. </li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">From <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150212023858/http://www.1-800-222-1222.info/" target="_blank">1-800-222-1222.info</a>: 1-800-222-1222
     is the telephone number for every poison center in the United States. Call
     this number 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to talk to a poison expert. Call
     right away if you have a poison emergency. Also call if you have a
     question about a poison or about poison prevention.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Thanks
     to uniform chemical handling rules, commonly called HAZMAT, HAZardous
     MATerial, laws/rules many products and the chemicals used to make them can
     be found by reading the MSDS for them. All major chemical makers doing
     business in the U.S provide MSDS and many are now online.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two are different sites for the same organization. You've probably
seen the PSA for 1-800-222-1222 on TV at various times. It is a very good
number to keep posted.</p>

<p>The last item covers way more than just poisons. </p>

<h2>What is a <del>MSDS</del> SDS?</h2>


<p><strong>Update:</strong> In 2012 OSHA revised its Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) to align with the United Nations&#8217; Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals. In short, changes mean:</p>
<ul><li>Material Safety Data Sheet is now called Safety Data Sheet.</li>
<li>Two sections, 2 and 3, switch numbers.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150212023858/https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/HCSFactsheet.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> to view the OSHA Fact Sheet for important dates and resources.</p>

<p><del>M</del>SDS, short for <del>Material</del> Safety Data Sheet, is a standardized paper that
describes some of the chemical properties of a product and now to handle the
product during various emergencies. It carries instructions for things like
fire fighting, ingestion and injury treatment. (I'm not editing the rest of this page just to meet OSHA&#8217;s terminology.)</p>

<p>You'll also find manufacturer contact info to obtain detailed HAZMAT cleanup
information. This data is important should there be a spill. USEPA and many
states require spill reporting for as little as 20-25 gallons of many things.
Even small amounts of chemicals like Mercury must be reported or you can face
huge fines.</p>

<p>While most people that know about MSDS associate them with HAZMATs, they
actually cover many things that are low to non-toxic. An amusing one is the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150212023858/http://www.chem.tamu.edu/class/majors/msdsfiles/msdswater.htm" target="_blank">MSDS for
Water</a>. (This is one of many versions.)</p>


<h2>Who cares?</h2>

<p>If you run a business you are often required to have the MSDS
sheets for all the chemicals you use. EPA and OSHA can and frequently do check
for MSDS to be on file and accurate for the business in question. A business
that fails to maintain a MSDS file can face stiff fines. (Note that many states
also require such record keeping.)</p>

<p>Even home users should look up a few MSDS sheets, especially for some of the
more toxic products. You'd be amazed how dangerous some stuff you use all the
time is.</p>

<h3>OSHA won't bother with me. I'm too small.</h3>

<p>If you really think anything like that, you've got problems that could
bankrupt you. All it takes is one small shop accident or disgruntled employee
to have OSHA or state equivalent inspectors all over your place. Paying Fines + Bad PR can hurt or even kill a small company.</p>

<h2>What MSDS does a service shop need to carry?</h2>

<p>Each of the chemical products you sell or use in shop should be on file.
Here are some examples for automotive service:</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Motor
     and transmission oils</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Gear
     lubricant</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Grease</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Antifreeze</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Brake
     fluid</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Windshield
     washer fluid</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Body
     Filler</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Parts
     washer (Includes canned products and the wash tub.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where can I get MSDS?</h2>

<p>Fortunately it is now fairly easy to find the MSDS for most things online,
simply type in a chemical or product name and MSDS into your favorite search
engine. Example for Google type in... &quot;Methyl Ethyl Ketone&quot; MSDS
(including the quotes.) You will get multiple sites with the MSDS for that one.
Why should you care about MEK? MEK is a potent solvent used in the hardener for
body filler and fiberglass and in many adhesives and cleaners. Purple Pipe
Cleaner for PVC plumbing is mostly MEK as is the adhesive.</p>

<p>Several makers like Exxon Mobil have web sites just for MSDS, same for
Chevron Texaco and other brands.</p>
