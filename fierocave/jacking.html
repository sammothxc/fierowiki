<h1>10 Rules For Safe Lifting</h1>

<h2>(At least...)</h2>

<p class="warn">Warning: The trunk's latch strike is NOT to use to lift the car. Trunk latch system is not made for a lifting spot and 
the strike will bend even break and dropping the car. Do Not use the strike for lifting car in engine/trans swap, etc. Ignore anyone that says it's OK.</p>
<p class="warn">Warning! You do all lifting and blocking at your own risk!</p>

<p class="note">WRONG! You do all lifting and blocking at the risk of yourself
and every person that may come near the vehicle. Including family friends and
children. Don't bitch at me if you do something half assed and drop a car on
someone.</p>

<p>Neighborhood children will frequently come up to a vehicle under repair.
They will even try to crawl under it to watch what you are doing. I regularly
have to tell other people's children to get back when I'm doing dangerous work
on a vehicle.</p>

<p>Your friends may know even less than you do about safe lifting. Don't trust
them not to drop your own car on you.</p>

<p class="note">This is ONLY a quick guide. It cannot possibly cover every lifting setup.</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">If it
     doesn't look safe, it probably isn't. </li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">When
     it does look safe, check it again.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">If
     it's been out of your sight, even a few minutes, check it again. God knows
     who may have screwed with it in that few minutes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even though these rules are numbered, they are all equally important.</p>
<ol>
<li>ALWAYS lift on a level surface!</li>

<li>NEVER get under a car supported only by a jack. All jacks are
subject to possible collapse. Hydraulic jacks are the worst but any jack can
fall.</li>

<li>ALWAYS use Jack Stands. The best stands are the 4-legged ratchet
type. Make sure the stands are rated for the vehicle in question.</li>

<li>ALWAYS use skid pads under jacks and stands when working on
dirt or blacktop. Without the pads, jacks and stands can sink into blacktop
even on seemingly cold days. Metal plate is best but <strong>thick</strong> plywood also works
as long as it has full contact under it.</li>

<li>Always block the wheels that stay on the ground in both
directions. If blocking only one wheel, block the one with the most load in it.</li>

<li>NEVER use any kind of Cement, Concrete, Clay/Red Brick, Rock,
or similar brittle materials for blocking. Such materials are extremely easy to
shatter when unevenly loaded.</li>

<li>Wood Blocks should be loaded across the grain, especially if
the contact area is narrow. </li>

<li>When stacking wood blocks, alternate the grain direction.</li>

<li>Ramps must never be used on dirt
or blacktop without skid pads. Many Steel ramp designs can sink into backtop or cut thru plywood.
Plastic ramps are light and spreads the load over a big area.</li>

<li>NEVER &quot;Take a run&quot; at a set of ramps. Ramps can and
will fly out if loaded suddenly or off center. If you have trouble
climbing ramps, buy ramp extension blocks. These products reduce the total
slope of the ramps. They are available at many of the same places that sell
ramps.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Rust</h3>

<p>After seeing this article Gordo in the forums had this to say:</p>

<p class="quote">I just read your article and I couldn't agree more. Safety
should be everyone's first concern. One point that I think needs to be
mentioned though is that these cars are going on 20 years old and some of the
areas (such as the jack stand areas on each side of the trunk) may be weakened
with rot. Especially if you live in the great white north. I have seen a jack
punch a hole through an engine cradle that looked ok on the bottom but was
rotted inside. Please be sure that your lift point is sound and if it isn't,
re-asses the safety of the entire car.</p>

<p>I used to live in NY but I've been in Delaware for some time so I didn't
even think about the rust factor. Something we used to do when I lived up there
was to give an intended jack point a whack with hammer. Assuming the hammer
doesn't dent the frame... It shouldn't... You can often tell by the sound an
area could be getting weak. (Even a 2-3 pound hammer won't dent good frame
unless you beat the hell out of it.)</p>

<h2>Jack Points</h2>
<p>The jack points below are from the shop/retail service manuals EXCEPT the
locations of the safety stands. The safety (jack) stand locations are mostly a
guess as a result of poor printing. I've also added a couple spots I use when
lifting only the rear of the car.</p>

<p><img width="576" height="362" src="/jacking_files/image002.gif" title="Jack Map" alt="Jack Map"></p>

<p>The above image is mainly a guide. It's not 100% accurate for all possible
lifting you will do, especially the spots for floor jacks and jack stands. 
(To clarify, I think the jack stand points shown by the trunk are the frame
rails not the actual trunk. It is a bit hard to tell in that picture,
especially the lower one.)</p>

<p>Besides the strength of a lift point, the main thing with jacks and jack
stands is to look at the angle of the frame spot you want to put it. </p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">If you
     use a frame rail, you want the spot on the rail as close to parallel to
     the round as you can get. If it's a jack spot you want it to stay fairly
     parallel as it lifts.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Hook
     the edge of a cross member that is, or will be, at an angle instead of
     putting the jack/stand in the middle of a big flat space.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Center
     a frame edge between the bumps around the edge of the lift cup on a
     hydraulic floor jack.</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea is to lock the top of the jack/stand so that the car won't spit it
out the first time you shake it.</p>
<h2><a name="cranes"></a>Cranes</h2>

<h3>AKA Cherry Picker, etc. </h3>

<p>When using a crane, watch length on lifting arm. Always set adjustable legs
to maximum length.<br>
Longer arm means less load arm can lift and can mean less stable when lifting
high. <br>
Many cranes are label but some don't have them or label has worn off.</p>

<p><img width="500" height="263" src="/jacking_files/image001.jpg" style="height:
263px;width:500px"><br>
Example from enginehoist.net</p>

<p>Most Crane's load rate as advertised is Maximum load and means shortest arm.
Harbor Freight and others 1 ton crane is only rated 500Lb when arm is at maximum
length. Too low for safe lifting a Fiero rear w/o cradle etc.</p>
