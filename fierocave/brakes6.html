<h1>Rear Caliper Compression</h1>

<p>Here's a driver's side caliper I've had sitting around awhile. Note that it
sat on a shelf for a year like this without pushing out the piston. I got it
off a junked Fiero for these pictures but didn't get around to shooting them until
now. I've already taken the E brake arm off and it is ready to squish.</p>

<p><img width="275" height="279" src="brakes6/image002.jpg"></p>

<p>Here's the caliper ready to squish with the clamp and socket in place. I
used a 15/16<sup>th</sup> socket so it would even clear the rubber around the
bolt.</p>

<p>This is the caliper post squish. The clamp take a bit of effort but the
piston goes right in. If it doesn't then the E brake screw is seized or the
piston is bad. </p>

<h2><a name="retract"></a>How to I tell when my piston is retracted enough?</h2>

<ol style="margin-top:0in" start="1" type="1">
 <li>Is the
     dust boot, even a part of boot, is flat? Then piston is bottom out.</li>
 <li>Dust
     boot is totally hosed? Piston to caliper body measures 
     <b>under</b> 5mm, 3/16in, then piston is at bottom.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How easy?</h2>

<p>GM uses Pliers to retract the piston. Pliers will work if
caliper and sliders are in good condition. Don't believe me? </p>

<p class="quote"><b>Remove or Disconnect</b></p>

<p class="quote">1. - 7. Similar to above method.</p>

<p class="quote">8. Bottom piston (17) into caliper bore to provide clearance
between linings and rotor (Figure 1).</p>

<p class="quote">&middot; Position 12 inch adjustable pliers (28) over caliper mounting
bracket, (31) and inboard caliper housing (25) (Figure 3).</p>

<p class="quote">CAUTION: Do not allow pliers to contact actuator screw.</p>
