<h1>Brake Recall and Adjusting the Rear Brakes</h1>
<h2>False Hope</h2>

<p>I've said:</p>

<p class="quote">Parking brakes should self-adjust but often don't. GM said the
rear disk brakes require periodic use of the hand brake to maintain proper
adjustment. I'm not going to try to explain why. It's just the way they are
built. (It's essentially a design problem.)</p>

<p>I've said this and is true but it is too simple and was posted years ago before I realized GM and others
blaming owners for not using the parking brake was and is total bull crap.
Worse, GM's <a href="brakerear-tsb.pdf">TSB
88-5-10 released 06/88</a> and Aftermarket (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181227/http://gafiero.akroncdnr.com/docs/FieroBrakeAdjustment.pdf" target="_blank">Example</a> at GA club site) give people the idea than manual
adjusting the rear brakes are Normal operation but that is far from the truth.</p>

<h4>Why Ogre?</h4>

<p>Because GM won't pass FMVSS to get new
models on the road with cars made to use parking brake to adjust
&quot;service&quot; brake. (Service brakes are main brakes for the vehicle.)
FMVSS 105 states:</p>

<p class="quote">S5. <i>Requirements</i>.</p>

<p class="quote">S5.1 Service brake systems. Each vehicle shall be equipped with
a service brake system acting on all wheels. Wear of the service brake shall be
compensated for by means of a system of automatic adjustment. ... </p>

<p>Plus GM's Adjustment TSB said:</p>

<p class="quote">The 1982-88 Firebird, 1984-87 Fiero, and 1984-88 6000 STE
vehicles with the <u>rear disc brake calipers are designed to automatically
adjust.</u> Some vehicles may experience increased rotor to lining clearance if the
rear calipers do not adjust fully.</p>

<p>(I added the underline.) Many have seen the TSB but just don't read and understand that statement.
Automatic means no actions from the Driver. This TSB is more
proof that the pistons often have problems.</p>

<h2>The Recall</h2>

<p>Many have seen the recall than affect some cars including 84-86 Fiero?
Michigan Fiero Club <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181227/http://www.michiganfieroclub.com/" target="_blank">
Home</a> has E-Brake recall TSB in Tech Tips.</p>

<p>NHTSA Recall only affects manual transmission cars because they need the
parking brake more so then automatic transmission cars. Problem is automatic
cars have the same problems. Proof is GM TSB # 88-5-19A applies to 82-88
Firebird, 84-87 Fiero, 83-88 6000 STE w/ Auto trans <i>but is not part of NHTSA
recall.</i> The Recall TSB and this are basically the same text etc on fixing same
problem.</p>

<p>Other models with rear disk brakes with the same piston design, including
1988 Fiero and 1980s Cadillac Seville, have the same problems but NHTSA recalls
only cover a small fraction of cars. People doing Seville rear gets vented
rotors but calipers with same problems as Fiero calipers.</p>

<p>Blaming owners hides the fact that the brake design had defects and getting
the owners to use the parking brake might help the system to work normally.</p>

<p>Car companies and parts makers often fight NHTSA Recalls or even hide data
from NHTSA because they cost money. Big examples: Takata Air Bag Inflators and
Toyota Gas pedal recall. When they do agree or force to recall vehicles, they
wanted to do the job as little work and parts as possible to save money. This is most likely
why the brake recall only applies to manual transmissions because the automatic
transmissions have the parking mechanism built-in and the owners often don't
use the parking brakes.</p>

<h2>Manually Adjustment or using Parking Brakes</h2>

<p>Using Parking/Emergency brakes or any other manually adjustment might help
but often is useless. I used my method for years because using P-brake didn't
help. Had to adjust every year... Even many rebuilt calipers have same problems
or worse.</p>

<p>Pistons that won't self adjust can blow out the back of the piston set
causing the pads to drag on the rotor. Pad dragging is a big problem and can
cause the pads to wear out fast, the rotors to warp, even cause fires or the
brake fluid to boil.</p>

<p>These two dead Pistons came from my car to fix dragging problems causing the
rotors to warp. These were Pistons that came in rebuilt calipers. (Rebuilt
calipers often have rebuilt or used Pistons.)</p>

<p><img border="0" width="611" height="290" src="brakerecall/badrebuildpiston.jpg" style="height:290px;width:611px"></p>
<p>(The "Good" piston is an old style and is a bit different than "bad" pistons.
Old style has the "adjusting nut," the threaded part, that goes thru back cover as above.
New style the "nut" is almost flushed with back cover.
Picture is what I had at the time.)</p>
<p>The blowout happens when inner piston is stuck and then the pads wear. That
creates a big load on the inner spring when you push the brake pedal that pops
out the sheet metal &quot;cover.&quot;</p>

<p>Only thing help was installing Recall Piston kit. (Kits are gone.) The
upgrade piston kit changes you can see: The new piston looses yellow plug,
moves Vent hole to the side behind the dust boot go sleep, and has &quot;Black
Oxide&quot; coating. Piston has internal changes too.</p>

<p>If you have problems retracting the Pistons and the adjustment screw turns
then you likely have failed Pistons inside like the above picture. 
Remember that using the clamp to compress the piston during works does not need much force.
If you have problems turning the clamp with your fingers then something is wrong. 
You can find
new rebuilt parts with blown Pistons right out of the box or a few days or
months after driving. Many of the rebuilt calipers come with a 90 day warranty
or less.</p>
