<h1>Ogre's Desktop Themes</h1>

<p>Update for Win7 Aero theme. When you extract files to C:\WINDOWS\Resources\Themes,
Win7 will show themes as Install Themes in Control Panel/Personalization.</p>

<p class="note">Download <a title="XP Theme" href="PFT.exe">WinXP/Win7 Themes</a></p>


<p>This theme is based on the &quot;Fiero2.bmp&quot; background
from the Pennock Fiero Forum CD-ROM. I liked this particular file so I built a
theme to go around it.</p>



<p>The Icons for the desktop are spun out from the small GIF
used as a bullet in Tunnel #6, The Ogre's Fiero Cave.</p>



<p>My Computer is a red Fiero. (My car is black but red went best
on the black background.)</p>

<p>Empty Recycle Bin is an Empty Flatbed Truck.</p>

<p>Full Recycle Bin is a Flatbed Truck with a Fiero on it.</p>

<p>My Documents is the Fiero Logo in 32x32 or a blue Fiero in
16x16. There is just no way to get the logo down to 16x16 and have it anything
but t blob.</p>

<p>Network Neighborhood is Delaware 
&quot;State Route&quot; 2,
also known as Kirkwood Hwy between Newark and Wilmington.
Like this horrid road, Network Neighborhood is a place most sane people avoid.</p>

<p>The cursor set is based on an old set from somewhere. I've
had them so long I can't remember where they came from. The set was originally
for WinNT3.51 and it didn't have all the cursors Win98 uses. I've edited and
added to the set. Nearly all of them are animated. </p>

<p>There are no sounds. The sounds assigned by the theme are
just common windows sounds.</p>



<p>Screen saver is set to Win2K 3D Pipes OpenGL screen saver.
The &quot;pft_txtr.bmp&quot; files are texture maps you can assign to give the
pipes sort of a dirty look. Look for an
Easter Egg... (Does work in Win7 32 and 64 bit.)</p>


<p>The &quot;Web View&quot; images are in here because Win98SE
shoved them in. I may edit them later. 2 of these are used in Windows Explorer
when &quot;as Web Page&quot; is checked in the View menu. I've no idea when the
logo one is used.</p>



<p>The theme is backward compatible with all the older versions
of Win9x. Your version will just ignore sections it doesn't support.</p>
