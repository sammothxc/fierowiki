<h1>Cranking Along</h1>

<p>I've broken this out from the TH125 page because I finally found the math
that shows the effect of changing tire sizes on the transmission. I'll add the
ratios for the various manual transmissions if/when I find it.</p>

<h2>Why do people change the Final Drive? What difference does that make?</h2>

<p>There are 2 main reasons to change the final drive of the transmission:</p>

<p>The first is to compensate for a change in tire diameter (Not rim diameter!).
Changing tire size alters the performance of the car. Changing the final drive
can restore the performance loss that comes with larger tires. While usually percieved 
as a truck issue, when people change to tires on 17" and larger rims, it will affect the car. 
Often more then you think.</p>

<p>The second is to increase launch torque or to get better highway mileage.
You can have one or the other, not both. Ratios closer to 1:1 get better
mileage and higher top speed but low torque. Ratios moving away from 1:1 increase 
torque at the sacrifice of mileage and top speed.</p>

<p><b>Note!</b> Doing an AOD (4T60, etc.) conversion? <a href="aodproj.htm">See Also Here.</a></p> 

<h2>TH125 &amp; 4T60 Gear Ratios</h2>


<p>When most people think about final ratios in TH125c (3T40) and 440-T4 (4T60)
transmissions, they simply assume that it means the final drive gears. Problem
is things don't work that way in these units. Here are the 10 RPO codes and the
three final gear sets that go with them.</p>

<p>Please note: The table above is based on information from a GM TSB 
and the transmission parts catalog from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150827000726/http://www.acerecon.com/" target="_blank">Aceomatic
Transmissions</a>. Those really are the only three final gear sets available for the TH125
or TH440-T4.</p>

<h3>The RPO list says F62 is 2.39:1. Something isn't right.</h3>

<p>Actually the RPO list is correct. Notice that the RPO list says &quot;Transaxle
Ratio&quot; not Final Drive or Axle. The confusion is caused by the fact there is
something else contributing to total gear reduction besides the final gear set.</p>

<h3>Why do some documents say different ratios for the same final gears?</h3>

<p>I finally found this explained in
yet another GM TSB. Apparently many GM dealer shops had the same question.</p>

<p class="quote">125C AND 440-T4 TRANSAXLE FINAL DRIVE</p>

<p class="quote">Subject: RATIO</p>

<p class="quote">Models: All 1980 - 1989 MODELS WITH 125C (3T40) OR 440T4 (4T60) TRANSMISSIONS</p>

<p class="quote">When identifying a 125C/Hydra-matic 3T40 or 440-T4/Hydra-matic
4T60 transaxle for the purpose of ordering parts, there may be conflicting
final drive ratios listed in different publications for the same transaxle I.D.
code.</p>

<p class="quote">Some sources, such as the Chassis Service Manual, may list the
actual ratio of the final drive in the transaxle. Other sources, such as the
GMSPO Parts catalog may list an &quot;AXLE RATIO&quot; which is figured using
ratio of the final drive assembly combined with the drive to driven sprocket ratio
of the drive chain.</p>

<p>In English... This means some documents report straight final drive ratio,
while others report the final ratio as the actual final gear ratio adjusted by the Chain ratio.
(This is why the RPO list doesn't jive with the actual final gears in many transverse
transmissions.)</p>

<p>Many people forget that you can have a gear reduction in the chain set in these
transmissions. (Many people don't even know there is a chain in these
transmissions....) This effectively alters the gearing of the whole
transmission just like changing the finals would. </p>

<h4>How does this work?</h4>

<p>Let's say two TH125c transmissions have 2.84:1 final gears. (Remember that third gear of
TH125c and 4T60 is 1:1!)</p>

<p>Transmission 1 has a 1:1 chain or 35 teeth on both chain sprockets. The
total gear reduction in this transmission is 2.84:1 in third gear. </p>

<p>Transmission 2 has a .84:1 chain or 38 teeth on the drive sprocket and 32 on
the driven sprocket. The total gear reduction in this transmission is 2.39:1 in
third gear.</p>

<h4>How many sets are there?</h4>

<p>For TH125c, there are four chain sets and three final sets totaling 12
possible combinations. Everything for the 4T60 is the same except that 38/32 (0.84:1)
chain was not used in that unit. </p>

<p>After originally posting this, partfiero told me there might be a 33/37
chain set. I was able to confirm this chain set actually exists thru the
Aceomatic catalog linked above. I think I finally have everything...</p>

<p>Here are all the possible ratios and the RPO codes for ones GM actually
built. These RPO codes are additional to the Transaxle Type RPO. This means
that on a vehicle's build sticker you'll find MD9 for TH125c (3T40) or ME9 for
440-T4 (4T60) and one of the codes below to tell you how the transmission is
geared. (Assuming you still have the original transmission...) The last column
reflects a couple spots where GM and MS Excel&nbsp;rounded the number
differently.</p>

<h3>Fiero Factory Setup</h3>

<p>Various people have said Fiero automatic transmissions are all setup as one
thing or another. A common statement will go &quot;all the L4 cars got 2.84
finals gears.&quot; While technically true, as we've seen final gear ratio is
not the only factor. Some of those 2.84 L4s are actually running 3.18:1
transmission ratios thanks to the chain set.</p>

<p>According to GM TSB 88-51 issued December 1988, these are all of the factory
TH125c configurations used in Fiero thru 1987. 
(1988 model info is a collection from 22P. Thanks Raydar. Going by the TC part numbers, I think the info is correct.) </p>

<p>Trans Model is on the tag/case under the Neutral Safety Switch.</p>

<p><b>NOTE: Do not use this table to order parts!</b> You must confirm the
model code on the transmission including a year digit that may precede the letters.
There are often important internal differences each year even though the models
are otherwise the same code. (TC Codes are explained in another article.)</p>

<p>Notice that according to the tables in the TC article... all of the Torque Converters
are listed as FWD units and all but one is 2060 Stall. The only real difference
is that the V6 units have a heavy duty TC clutch.</p>

<p>I did find the range of final gearing interesting. This helps explain some
of the variations in fuel economy people see. </p>

<h2>How are final ratios and tires related?</h2>

<p>If you increase the tire size, you reduce the effective gear ratio. This is
ok if you want highway mileage but not good for drag racing or autocross.</p>

<p>Allot of people want the tire to better fill the wheel well, so lets say you
want a larger tire on a 17inch wheel. (I just made up a size for the 17inch. I
don't know if you can actually get it.) To find how the new wheel alters
performance, we can do a bit of basic math. </p>

<p>We need only three bits of information:</p>

<p>The original tire size, 195/75R14, has a diameter = 25.5 inch (<span style="color:red">OldTD</span>)</p>

<p>The new tire size, 225/60R17, has a diameter = 27.6 inch (<span style="color:red">NewTD</span>)</p>

<p>OE Ring &amp; Pinion Ratio 3.06:1 (<span style="color:red">OERatio</span>) </p>

<p>We're only concerned with the rolling diameter of the tires. Tire profile
and rim size aren't important for this. You can get this info from either the
tire maker (catalog or web site) or you can use the tire size calculators on
the links page.</p>

<p>Note that it is important to know the ratio of the gears that are actually
in the transmission. We don't want a published ratio that may have been &quot;adjusted&quot;
for whatever reasons by the carmakers. We've also got to keep in mind that the
choices of alternate gears are usually very limited. That means we've got to
balance the tires to available gear sets.</p>

<p>That means when you change to the 17inch tire, the car performs as if the
gears dropped to 2.83:1. You get better top end but will launch more slowly. 
It's the same effect as changing the TH125 to 2.84 gears with the stock tire.</p>

<p>To get back the same performance we need a new set of gears, to find them we run
another calculation...</p>

<p>A 3.31:1 gear set would return the car to the same performance as original.
The closest TH125 alternative is 3.33:1 so that works out well for the new 17&quot;
tire. You'll end up with performance as if the car was geared down very slightly.
That means slightly faster launches without totally squashing fuel economy.</p>

<p>Note that since Fiero VSS reads Axle rotations, Speedometer output doesn't
change relative to final gears. Speedo recalibration is yet another calculator.
Nearly all the transverse transmissions have the speedo reading axle rotation
vs. traditional RWD where the speedo reads drive shaft rotations at the
transmission. </p>

<p>For most people with an automatic, the best way to change final drives will
be to change the whole transmission. This is because the governor in TH125 and
several other GM transverse transmissions reads axle rotation. Changing finals
without correcting the governor function could mess up shift timing. There may
be other factors involved as well. This puts changing finals out of the reach
of most DIY folks.</p>

<p>Even for the stock manual transmissions, it's probably better to change the
whole transmission than try to change the finals. Manual transmissions may seem
easier to work with but they really aren't. You can easily cause all sorts of
problems unless you handle them very carefully. The problems may not show up
right away. </p>

<p>Depending on how the ECM is programmed, changing finals could also set error
codes. I'm not aware of this being a problem in Stock Fiero but some of the
engine conversions could have a fit if the finals are too far from what the
ECM/PCM expects.</p>

<p>When used with one of the Java based tire size calculators (In the links
section) you can work all the numbers fairly quickly for a whole range of tire
sizes. The math above will tell you how bad it will hurt performance. The tire
calculator will tell you how far off a new tire will put the speedometer. The
tire calculators can also be used to find various tire sizes that match OE
diameter or will work with different gear sets. </p>

<p>Any tire with 25.5inch diameter, such as 225/55R16 (25.6inch diameter), can
replace the 195/75R14 without significantly messing up performance or the
speedometer no matter what the rim size is. That 16inch tire is only one tenth of
an inch larger. You get a short sidewall for better handling but only mess up
the speedometer by 0.9% vs. a 3% error changing to a 195/70R14.</p>

<p>Likewise changing from 3.06 to 3.33 gears would work for any tire of similar
diameter to our sample 17inch one.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you've already got 3.33:1 gears in a TH125 then you'll
have no choice but eat a performance change if you install larger tires unless
you can find aftermarket gears with a higher ratio.</p>
