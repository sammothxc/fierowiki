<h1>Small Motors Bring Big Problems</h1>

<p>First, you must remember this... <i>Small electric motors are rated in </i><b><i>Watts</i></b><i>.</i></p>

<p class="note">And Watts = Volts x Amps.</p>

<h4>But Ogre, my car uses 12 volt system.</h4>

<p>So what? Cars get 12.6V on full charge battery, 14.7V on alternator... Voltage
varies widely, 12 or less on dead battery to 14-15 to charge the battery. Never
assume it is 12v, measure it with a good Volt meter at the circuit you are
looking at. </p>

<h4>But Ogre, over current will blow the fuse.</h4>

<p><b><i>False.</i></b> Fuses and Fuse Link are there to protect the wire and
not the motors, light bulbs, etc. (One exception... The Inst Fuse to protect
the dimmer transistor.) Some circuits, like radiator fan motor, gets power from
a Fuse Link and the Fuse Link likely <i>will not</i> blow from an over current
motor. There 3 Fuse Links in headlight system and the motors will tear itself
apart and almost never has a Fuse Link is blown.</p>

<h2>Low Volt means High Current</h2>

<p>High Current (Amp) is bad for:</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Fan motor for radiator</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Fuel Pump</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">AC/Heater Blower</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Headlight Motors</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Starter</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">And much more...</li>
</ul>

<p>But how do you get high current? From Low Voltage cause by low battery, bad
wires, bad/loose ground, and any number of other items.</p>

<p class="note">Remember... Watts = Volts x Amps.</p>

<p>Watts is a <i>constant</i> so Voltage goes down then Current (Amp) must go
up to meet the Wattage uses. Many circuits usually Hate high current and damage,
even kill, relays switches and motors.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Radiator Fan Motor is rated at 150 Watts and uses 10-11 Amps about 14 Volts
normally. But have a mess up ground and now get 10 volt, motor uses 15 amp. Really
bad ground? Say 7 volts? Motor u<i>ses nearly 21.5 amps!</i> That will blow the
motor and/or relay to controls the motor.</p>

<p>Fuel pump use 7-8 amps normally... So 8 x 14 = 112 Watts. Plus Fuel Pump is
very small motor and even need gas for coolant as well... Any low volt and high
amp means a dead fuel pump is easy. Short in oil pressure sender, bad wire
harness, and you new fuel pump will die too.</p>

<h2>How do I test?</h2>

<p class="note">Note: Do not try to test the Starter circuit using this method. 
Just replace both battery cables when replacing the Starter. 
The Starter is rated 1.5-1.7 <i>Killo Watts</i>.
</p>

<p>By using a volt meter is obvious but &quot;load&quot; the circuit is not
obvious to most people. Normal load is the Motor, etc, but you are trying to
see if you got a bad motor or bad/loose wires and ground. You need a Test Load
and is cheap is a plus.</p>

<p>Make a Test Load by using one or two Headlight bulb.</p>

<p>Plus headlight bulb gives you a quick test... Noticeable Dim bulb mean bad
wire/ground but always use a volt meter to. </p>

<p>Use the meter to test without load and with load. Meter should see the same voltage
or very close. If you see 12.6V unloaded and 11V loaded then you likely found
you're problem.</p>

<h4>I need a quick test to make my fuel pump has good wire/ground.</h4>
<p class="warn">Warning: Check/repair grounds at G201 &amp; G202. (See <a href="ecmwire.htm">Wire Service</a> article.) 
These two grounds are used by most interior items and the <i>Fuel Pump.</i></p>
<p>Do the same test. Unplug the motor and test voltage. Plug in motor a test
again. <b>But note...</b> Fuel Pump Always Need Gas for Coolant! Put two gallons
of gas before you test a new pump. (See C502 in Service Manual, etc. C502 is
last place you can disconnect the pump with out dropping the tank.) </p>

<h4>I want to make a test load like a motor uses.</h4>

<p>Headlight bulb is reliable test to. We can tell you how many Amps to see
load is equivalent to motor.</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Look up the Wattage the bulb uses.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">All headlight makers uses 12.8 volt to test. (See FMVSS
     571.108)</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">So 65W/12.8V=5.1A (65w is high beam Halogen)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can play mix and match to get Test Load to make motor equivalent that
way.</p>
