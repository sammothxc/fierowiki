<h1>Strut safely</h1>

<p class="warn">Warning! Improper handling of shocks and struts can cause serious injury or
death. Never Heat, Cut, Drill, Beat, or Bend Shocks or Struts. Depending on
type, gas shocks/struts contain Nitrogen gas at pressure ranging from 60-500 PSI
(4-30 BAR). However even non-gas shocks can rupture and spray hot oil if over
heated.</p>

<p class="warn">Warning! Because of the large array of spring compressors available it is
not possible to describe every detail of their use. Make absolutely certain you
understand your compressor fully before use. Use all safety devices originally
included with your compressor. Addition safety equipment may be required.</p>

<h2>Did he say don't bend them?</h2>

<p>Yeah, I figured you'd get a jolt from that. Some alignment shops have been
known to use a bending process to align certain strut systems. The process
should never be used on gas charged struts. In Fiero this should not be needed
since all aftermarket struts slotted for camber adjustment. (If you ever need a
caster adjustment on a Fiero rear then something major is wrong.) You should
also be using &quot;cam bolts&quot; when they are installed. These bolts allow easy
adjustment of the camber.</p>

<h2>How long will this take?</h2>

<p>While shocks are usually an afternoon project, struts should not be planned
that way. </p>

<p>Do not expect to walk into a parts store and walk out with all the stuff you
need. The Cam Bolts and boots/bumpers will likely need to be special ordered.
Many stores don't even have the shocks and/or the struts in stock. Most of the
parts can be received within 24-48 hours. Start buying parts a week before you
plan to do the job and plan to buy from multiple sources. I got my cam bolts
and spring compressor from Advance Auto and the shocks/struts from Pep Boys.</p>

<p>The actual work will depend mainly on the condition of your present
hardware. If you don't run into problems you can have the struts changed in
about 3-4 hours. (Faster with air tools...)</p>

<p>You also need to plan to change the shocks in most cases. That's another 2-4
hours if nothing goes wrong. (Doesn't make much sense to replace the struts and
leave bad shocks on it.) There are some shock installation tips at the end of
this article if you need them.</p>

<p>Plus the time it takes to have it aligned after everything is done.</p>

<h2>Will this mess up my alignment?</h2>

<p>Absolutely. While there are methods and tools that will let you set the
camber close to where it started, the car MUST be aligned after changing struts.
Small alignment errors will usually have a large effect on Fiero handling and
tire wear.</p>

<p>Do Not drive the car any more than you need to get to the alignment shop.
Even if the car feels ok. Your tires can wear very quickly if the alignment is
even a little off.</p>

<p>(Changing shocks only usually won't upset the alignment much if at all.)</p>

<h3>How can I get the alignment somewhat close?</h3>

<p>This is the method I used to set my new struts. This is just to get it
reasonably close. It's not intended to be any type of permanent thing. (When we
put it on the rack, I ended up with one tire's camber ok but the other was
still off some.)</p>

<p>You need a level. A dial type one is best but a bubble will work in a pinch.
I used a regular magnetic bubble level to do mine. There are nice levels made
specifically for this job. Check the tool suppliers.</p>

<ol>
<li>Jack the car, lower it onto a jack stand and remove the wheel.</li>

<li>Reinstall 2 lug nuts to hold the brake rotor tight to the hub.</li>

<li>Place the level on the brake rotor. Make sure it's flat against whatever
area of the rotor you use. I put it against the mounting flange and not the
actual rotor. </li>

<li>Use a piece of masking tape to mark the pointer location or one end of the
bubble.</li>

<li>Install the new strut. DO NOT change the position of the car while you work.</li>

<li>Adjust the new strut until the level returns to the previously marked
position.</li>

<li>Hold that position while tightening the bolts.</li>
</ol>

<p>This should get you close but you still need a full alignment. There's
enough variation between the old and new that even if you got it exactly right
with the level, the alignment is probably still off once the tire is back on.</p>

<h2>I can't get the big bolts loose!</h2>

<p>You need a Big wrench or cheater bar for the bolts at the bottom of the
strut. These bolts are Class 10.9 (SAE Grade 8) or higher and are torqued to around 190 pound
feet. Add some rust to that and it can take allot of force to undo them.</p>

<p>If the bolts are badly rusted, it can also help if you support the control
arm with a bottle jack. Make sure you place the support where it can't bend the
arm or break off the grease fitting on the ball joint. The bottle jacks work
well because you can snug them up but still easily release them once the strut
is loose. That gives you allot more control than blocking material.</p>

<h2>Where do I get the cam bolts for the new struts?</h2>
<p class="warn">Notice: The Monroe AK-30 bolt kit no longer contains the cam head bolt.</p>
<p>I believe Moog and some others still offer a suitable bolt product. Some kits cost significantly 
more than the AK-30 Kit so shop around. That said... there may be some old stock of 
the AK-30 kit running around some places. It's worth a try if you can find them.</p>

<p class="quote">One source is Monroe part number AK-30. Use the search by part number function
available at most online sources. Search for AK30. (NAPA online lists some but
they cost twice as much.) I could not find any parts stores that had them in
stock. It took about 2 days to get them thru Advance Auto.</p>

<p>2000RagTop reports:</p>
<p class="quote">I found the Cam Strut Bolts at Napa.
Part Number 264-3609
cost was $8.89 ea. 2 needed.</p>
<p class="quote"><img src="strut/cam_bolt_napa.jpg"></p>

<p>There are two styles of cam bolt. Both have a cam permanently attached to
the bolt head. Some have a second cam that slides over the threads.</p>

<p>It does not matter which kind you use. The second cam really isn't 
needed and because the bolt has a flat side it
allows much more trash into the nut that will cause corrosion. Unfortunately 
this is the only sort you can get now...</p>

<h3>Can I install the new struts without the cam bolts?</h3>

<p>Technically Yes, but don't. The alignment people will hate you and may even
refuse to do the work if the cam bolts aren't installed. You'll usually get a
better alignment with the cam bolts than without.</p>

<p>The cam bolts allow the tech to easily set and hold the camber adjustment
while tightening the nut. Without the bolts, the tech has to muscle the
adjustment which will likely move as he tightens the nut.</p>

<h2>What about getting and using Spring Compressors?</h2>

<p class="warn">Warning: Do Not use an impact wrench on the compressor! </p>

<p><img width="305" height="193" src="strut/image001.gif" align="left" hspace="12">It
takes surprisingly little effort to compress the springs. You don't need an
impact wrench and in fact you can damage most compressors using one. I just
used a standard 1/2 drive ratchet and extension. Any air ratchet would work
just fine if you've got one.</p>

<p>Nearly any tools supplier and most parts stores have them. Autozone, Pep Boys, and some
others may have loaner units you can sign out with a deposit.</p>

<p>I got mine at Advance Auto. It's an AmPro T70570 and was about $25 plus tax.
This one has nice wide jaws to grab the springs. I figure I'll only use it a
few times so I didn't see any sense in buying an expensive unit. (That's it in
the image.) This one also has 1/2 inch drive holes in the bolt heads. That
means you just need a ratchet handle and extension to use it.</p>

<p>I definitely prefer screw compressors with wide jaws on both ends. Wide jaws
reduce the spring's tendency to bow out in the middle.</p>

<p>One thing that's a must with screw type compressors... make sure you lube
the thrust washer and threads EVERY TIME YOU USE THEM! This will make them last
far longer and reduce the chance of the threads stripping when the thing is
under load. It also reduces the effort to operate them. </p>

<p>On the other hand, clean away any dirt/grease/oil on the spring and the jaws
to prevent the compressor from slipping. (The first time you use a new screw
compressor, grease the bolthole in the &quot;head end&quot; jaw.)</p>

<h3>I don't want to mess with a compressor... </h3>

<p>You can take all the stuff to allot of service centers and parts stores to
have the springs and stuff moved to the new struts. Cost of that varies by
store. This will reduce your work to removing and installing only the strut
assembly.</p>

<p>I figured for the cost of the AmPro compressor I may as well do it myself and 
save running to/from the parts store and the wait for them to do it. Even if a shop 
costs less, that way still takes allot of time.</p> 

<h2>Any tricks on disassembly?</h2>

<p>Don't worry if the compressors are at an angle relative to the strut. You
want the jaws to fully seat onto the spring. Just let the compressor align to
the spring wire the way it wants to. Most strut spring compressors will tend do
this and if you fight them they will likely slip under load.</p>

<p>Also, try to keep the drive screw threads from rubbing the spring. If you
can't avoid that then grease the spot where the spring hits the screw to
minimize damage to the threads.</p>

<p>Some compressors may fit better &quot;head down&quot; relative to the strut. I found
using the compressor head down also made reassembly easier later on.</p>

<p>If you can't remove the top nut, cut it with a Dremel tool and a heavy-duty
cutting wheel or some other kind of saw. (No Torches! Heat will damage the top
plate!) Whack the split with a chisel or center punch to spread the nut and it
should come right off. (Support the nut when you hit it! You don't want to
rattle the spring and risk slipping the compressor.)</p>

<p>The new struts should come with new top nuts. Use them. The threads aren't
the same on every strut made. (My new struts had finer threads than the old
ones.)</p>

<p>DO NOT leave a compressed spring unattended! If you run into a problem once
the strut is apart, put the spring back on the strut and put the top plate and
nut back on. This will help reduce the chance of flying parts while you figure
out what is wrong.</p>

<p>Once the spring is compressed, treat it like a small bomb. Don't bang it
around. You can never be 100% sure that it won't slip or a compressor part
won't break. Handle it in a way that if things go wrong you won't get pinched
or struck by the spring and other parts. That thing can easily remove fingers.
Don't leave the spring compressed any longer than absolutely necessary. </p>

<p>Make sure all screw type compressors are 180 degrees apart on the spring. If
the spring insists on bowing try moving the compressors a little and try again.
(Bowing generally won't be a problem with wide compressor jaws.)</p>

<p>Be Extremely Careful! If that thing gets loose it can kill someone. The compressor
will place hundreds of pounds of load on that spring. The spring and/or
compressor can fly with tremendous force. (Yes, people have been injured and
even killed by flying parts from accidents doing this kind of work.)</p>

<p>Compress the spring only enough to unload the strut pulse a few turns. The
extra few turns should allow for slight differences between struts. You want to
avoid adjusting the compressor unless the spring is trapped by the strut and
top plate.</p>

<h2>Strut Boots and/or Bumpers...</h2>

<p>The strut bumper needs to be there. The dust sleeve/boot is semi optional.
If you want the best life from your struts these need to be in good shape,
especially on lowered vehicles. Struts can and will slam themselves and the top
plate to pieces on lowered cars if the bumpers are missing. Even on stock
vehicles the struts can slam going over large things like speed bumps. </p>

<p>Monroe, Gabriel, and others still list replacement boots and bumpers.
Depending on the source, you may even be able to get various colors of boot. You
may have to special order them.</p>

<p>Gabriel has nice boot/bumper sets. Theirs are a true bellows design and made
to be sealed to the strut top. </p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Again, the new struts should have new top nuts. Use them. Make sure it's
tight because you probably won't be able to torque them again later. (You need
special tools for that once the strut is installed. There's no room for regular
wrenches.)</p>

<p>Make sure the spring is correctly aligned on both perches. This can be a bit
tricky. This part is easier if the strut is head down while you let
off the compressors. That way every thing rests nicely against the top plate 
while you guide the spring to the lower perch.</p>

<p>Check the upper sections of the spring for wear. Coat areas that rub with
silicone brake grease. (Brake grease won't wash out as easily.)</p>

<p>There's not much to reinstalling the assembly. It can help to have another
person around. You can do it by yourself, it just awkward to get everything to
line up at times.</p>

<p>I found it's easier to get it back together if you can get the long top stud
started with a nut then the other two. (Don't forget the oval shaped
reinforcing plates.) Once they are all started then get the big bolts in their
holes. Go back up top and run all three nuts home. </p>

<p>Leave the nut that holds the vent grate bracket loose until you're done with
the rest of the strut. Put the vent grate on the car, tighten the retainer
screw(s), and then tighten the nut that holds the bracket. That way everything
should line up in one try.</p>

<h2>What are the best shocks/struts?</h2>

<p>I don't think there is a best and I think in most settings it simply doesn't
matter as long as you use an established brand of high quality gas charged
product. Any shock/strut set you buy today will be considerably better than
what was originally on the car, including whatever was used in WS6 cars. The
better products are all gas charged and contain some type of road sensitive
valve system.</p>

<p>The most important thing is that shocks and struts be treated as a matched
set. </p>

<p>Example one, you don't want Monroe shocks mixed with Gabriel struts or that
sort of thing. They would work safely, but the differences between brands could
produce some subtle handling issues.</p>

<p>Example two, don't mix gas and non-gas products. This can have very
unpredictable results. It's the shock equivalent of mixing radial and bias ply
tires. You never quite know what you're gonna get or under what conditions a
problem might show up. The car should be safe but handling won't be the best.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that gas shock/struts will affect ride height and spring rate.
The car will usually sit a little higher with fresh units in place.</p>

<h2>Product Review</h2>

<p>The AmPro spring compressor I used is quite well made for the
price. It doesn't have additional hardware to hold onto the spring like some
others. It doesn't really need anything else. I found the tool to be very well
made and very stable. The wide jaws grab firmly on the spring and have no
tendency to migrate during use. The drive screws have hex heads but the 1/2
inch drive holes eliminate the need to use a socket to turn them.</p>

<p>One thing I thought was odd... The compressor screws came with lock washers
on them. I'm not sure if that was designed that way or someone simply put the
wrong ones on at the factory. It didn't seem to matter since the washer can't
lock. (You'll see what I mean if you use it.) I used it as supplied this time.
Before future use I'll change those to regular flat washers just to prevent
wear on the bolts or jaws.</p>

<p>I went with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181139/http://www.gabriel.com/" target="blank">Gabriel</a> Pro Ryder gas
shocks and Gas Ryder struts, both with VST. They
provide good ride and handling from my sport optioned Fiero. The sport version
already has a pretty stiff suspension. As a daily driver I didn't want it any
stiffer because of the shocks/struts. I'm very happy with the results. They are
made in U.S.A. for people who need that info.</p>

<p>The Monroe AK30 cam bolt kits are serious hardware. The bolts exceed grade
10 and are the single cam type that I prefer. They worked just fine with the
Gabriel struts and should work just as well with any other brand.</p>

<h2>Links</h2>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181139/http://www.monroe.com/" target="blank">Monroe</a> has some interesting explanations
of how shocks and struts work. Not much product data. They have you call an 800
number for part number lookups. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181139/http://www.gabriel.com/" target="blank">Gabriel,</a> a division of ArvinMeritor,
has better product data and an online catalog. You can see a picture of their
nice Strut Cushion&trade; boot/bumper on the products page. The also explain how VST
works. (ArvinMeritor also makes Purolator and Maremont products.) That strut
cushion looks like it should fit most struts regardless of brand but it may not
work with coil over conversions and custom stuff like that.. </p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181139/http://www.trade-winds.net/ampro/" target="blank">AmPro</a> has a web site for
what it's worth... There's not much info there. They may not be the &quot;pro&quot; grade
stuff like Snap-on, S-K, etc, but they will do well for good tools on a budget.
I've had their serpent belt tool for a while. Who wants to spend a fortune on a
tool for occasional use? I figure I'll use a spring compressor about once or
twice a decade...</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181139/http://www.kyb.com/" target="blank">KYB</a> for those interested... They have nice
stuff and it's allot of it is competitive with most other brands. If you're
into racing these should do well for allot less than Koni. They've also got an
explanation of what the top assembly on FWD struts does and how it screws up
when it's bad. (Fiero top plate is just a bushing. Essentially it's either good
or bad and is pretty easy to spot.)</p>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181139/http://www.koni.com/" target="blank">Koni</a> since we're on the subject... They
explain allot of handling terms and so on in addition to product info.</p>

<h2>Shock it to me</h2>

<p>Before starting to remove the shock, set up a bottle jack under the tip of
the Lower Control Arm. Make sure the jack doesn't load on the grease fitting in
the ball joint. You'll need the jack to unload the existing shock and hold up
the LCA so you can install the new one.</p>

<p>If the bottom bolt is stuck in the sleeve, twist it around until you find
the seam in the sleeve. (Most shocks have a rolled sleeve.) Center punch on or
right next to the seam to split it open. That usually will unload it enough to
let go of the bolt. It will also let in penetrating oil. </p>

<p>If it's not already loose, the sleeve will usually tear loose from the
bushing fairly easy. Just be careful. It can snap a wrench pretty far if you
don't have a good grip.</p>

<p>Coat the bolt and the inside of the sleeve with grease or anti seize to
prevent the same problem in future. Anti seize the top bolts too. </p>

<p>Replacement bolts for shocks don't have to be anything special any bolt that
fits will work. </p>
