<h1>Batteries</h1>

<p class="warn">Warning! The OE routing of the positive battery cable is at best
poorly done in many Fiero. As a result, the pulleys and belts can easily damage
the cable. This cable MUST be physically inspected and replaced if there is any
damage. (See Wire Service for details.)</p>

<h2>Some Battery Terms</h2>

<dl>
<dt>CA</dt><dd>Output Amps at 32&deg;F</dd>
<dt>CCA</dt><dd>Output Amps at 0&deg;F</dd>
<dt>Reserve Capacity (in Minutes)</dt><dd>How long battery will last at 80&deg;F with 25A load before the charge is below 10.5 volts.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Difference in CA and CCA mean a big amp drop in 32&deg;F, a 150+A loss in most cars.</p>
<p>Reserve Capacity means...
If you left HL etc on then will come back to dead battery or not depending on Reserve Cap spec.
If Alt goes dead... you might have a short time to drive the cars before battery is dead.
Having 60+ minutes of Reserve Time is very good when alt is dead... I can drive home w/o any problems and did so when alt died. </p>

<p>More see my <a href="csalt2.htm">Watt Story</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181127/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_battery" target="_blank">Automotive battery</a> from Wikipedia.

<h2>What's the Difference?</h2>

<p>Standard vehicle starting batteries are designed to flow huge currents for
short periods. They don't like things like trolling motors on a fishing boat or
running lights in a parked RV. Discharging a vehicle starting battery below
10-11V can damage them. Discharging them completely can ruin them. Starting
batteries are built using Wet Cell or AGM designs. (I don't know of any Gel
Cell starting batteries.)</p>

<p>Deep Cycle batteries are just the opposite. They are made for sustained
loads of moderate current draw. You can quickly ruin them by repeatedly
starting an engine. Deep Cycle batteries will accept being drawn down more than
a starting battery but they don't like being run flat. Deep Cycle batteries can
be constructed using Wet Cell, Gel Cell, or AGM designs.</p>

<p>Differences from brand to brand often don't mean very much. Typical wet cell
batteries last anywhere from 2-5 years depending on environmental and vehicle
conditions. (Wet Cell as the name implies use liquid electrolyte that sloshes
pretty freely in each cell.)</p>

<p>The new AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) batteries are supposed to last twice as
long or more than regular batteries. They can also be constructed for greatly
increased resistance to vibration. Optima and Orbital are the two best-known
AGM batteries. Delphi also makes one that is original equipment in some GM
cars.</p>

<p>AGM batteries are NOT Gel Cells! Where Gel batteries contain a gelling agent
in the electrolyte, AGM batteries use liquid that has been soaked into glass
mats between the plates. The electrolyte still has some flow thru the mats and
plates. Like Gel Cell they are virtually spill proof.</p>

<p>Gel Cells are not normally used in motor vehicle applications. These deep
cycle batteries are used in emergency lighting, backup power systems,
children's toys, and many others.</p>

<h2>Charge!</h2>

<p>A 12V lead acid battery is fully charged at 12.6-13V. The general formula for a 
Lead Acid battery is 2.1 volts per cell. A 12V battery has 6 cells. A cell is fully charged at 2.1-2.2 volts. 
Trying to charge a cell much over that will kill it just as easily as discharging it too far.</p>

<p>If you deep discharge a starting battery or run any battery flat then <span style="text-decoration:underline;">DO
NOT fast/boost charge it!</span> You'll have much better odds of salvaging the battery
with a regular slow charger and letting it work over night. (Not a
&quot;trickle charger.&quot;) </p>

<p>Fast charging should be avoided whenever possible. It may get you going
short term but will likely result in greatly shortened battery life. 
(Some batteries take fast charging better than others. If in doubt, go slow.)</p>

<p>The best chargers are &quot;taper&quot; or &quot;smart&quot; units that
automatically adjust charge rate according to battery needs. These will reduce
current as the battery builds up, finally cutting off or switching to
&quot;trickle&quot; mode at full charge.</p>

<p class="note">Note: Don't assume an alternator is dead! Many modern Alternators
will not turn on if the battery is below some set value. For CS alternators,
that means the battery has to be over about 12V or the alternator will not turn
on. This is done to protect the alternator from overload.</p>

<p>Notes: <br>
This table's voltage is with battery has some time to rest 
after engine's run or charger in use.<br>
The state of charge listed is an approximation. The relationship
between state of charge and voltage vary by CCA rating, Temperature, and case
size.</p>
<h2>My Battery Died... Again.</h2>
<p class="note">Note: 84-86 model use Generation 1 Headlight Motors. First check the motor is not bad. Bad Gen 1 motor(s) is likely a problem.
</p>

<p>If your battery keeps going dead after a day or three, have it fully charged
and then load tested. This is a common symptom of a bad battery. A load test
will quickly confirm the problem.</p>

<p>Better yet, there is a new type of computerized tester available at a growing 
number of shops and parts stores. These testers can often find problems with a battery 
before traditional load testing can. Many of these units can even test discharged 
batteries. That saves time and avoids safety issues of trying to charge a fried battery.</p>

<p>Once you are sure the battery is good, <a href="bat_leach.htm">read this
page on tracking parasitic power problems.</a></p>

<h2>Battery Cables</h2>

<p>Replace, at least test, battery cables at same time when you replace the battery. 
Weak cables are high on the list of screwing up starters. 
See <a href="ecmwire.htm#cables">Battery Cables</a> in Wire Service.</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>When storing a vehicle, disconnect the battery. If the vehicle will be
stored outside, bring the battery indoors.</p>

<p>The battery will last much better if kept at stable temperatures. Anything
from around 40F to &quot;Room temperature&quot; is good.</p>

<p>You should also check the charge every couple weeks, once a month at least.
If the charge drops put the battery on an automatic charger that will shut off
or switch to &quot;trickle.&quot; Don't leave the battery on the charger all
the time. Don't use a &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;boost&quot; mode to charge it.</p>

<h2>Who made it?</h2>

<p>Before you buy one, it's nice to know who made it.</p>

<p>There are three main auto battery makers in North America. Whatever brand is
on it, most retail batteries are made by these three.</p>

<h3>Johnson Controls</h3>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181127/http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/" target="_blank">Johnson Controls</a> markets under
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181127/http://www.optimabatteries.com/" target="_blank">Optima</a>, Diehard (Sears, NTB),
EverStart (Wal-Mart), Interstate, Motorcraft and a bunch of other brands. (They
also made the battery with anti-theft protection for Sears.) </p>
<p>Note that there are at least <span style="font-weight:bold;">4 (Four)</span> types of Optima! If you use the wrong one you will kill it. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Consult the Optima web site to determine which battery is right for you!</span></p>

<p>Optima batteries <i>are not gell cells!</i></p>
<p class="quote">Johnson Controls has developed absorbent glass mat (AGM)
 technologies in both spiral and flat plate configurations. 
The spiral wound Optima and Inspira product lines are produced in North America, 
while the flat plate products are developed and produced in Europe.</p>

<h3>Exide</h3>

<p>Orbital is an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181127/http://www.exideworld.com/" target="_blank">Exide</a> product. Their
product is sold mainly under Exide and Champion brands. I think K-mart
currently carries Exide. (They also make NASCAR Select batteries.)</p>

<p>Orbital batteries <i>are not gell cells!</i></p>
<p class="quote">Exide's Orbital Grid design and absorbent glass-mat (AGM) separator

<h3>Delphi</h3>

<p>Delphi sold battery line to Johnson Controls.</p>

<h2>Are there other Brands?</h2>

<p>Yes, there are other brands that aren't well know even though
they may have been around a long time. One is 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181127/http://www.douglasbattery.com/" target="_blank">Douglas</a>, a brand sold thru
many parts stores. Another is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181127/http://www.eastpenn-deka.com//" target="_blank">Deka</a>, 
who is better known for specialty batteries used to run electric forklifts and other comercial/industrial power systems</p>


<h2>Recycling</h2>

<p>There is no excuse for dumping dead car batteries in the what ever hole you
find! Car batteries are considered hazardous waste and you can be fined for dumping
them illegally. Most residential and commercial trash haulers won't take them.</p>

<p>It's not hard to find a place to unload them properly. I believe all places
in the U.S. that sell automotive batteries are legally required to accept the
dead ones. Many places even have core charges on the used batteries so they
will get them back. </p>

<p>In many cases the chain stores will accept all dead batteries, regardless of
where they came from. I've dropped off dead batteries at K-Mart, Wal-Mart, and
other places. Even K-Mart stores without an auto center will take them; simply
drop them off at the customer service desk. (You might even get a buck for them.)</p>

<p>There is also scrap value in them. If you have a bunch of dead ones around
there are places that will buy them.</p>
