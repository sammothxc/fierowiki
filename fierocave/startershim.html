<h1>Starter</h1>

<p class="note">Note: Per GM (Multiple Doc) Never operate the starter more than
30 second at a time without pausing to allow it to cool for at least two
minutes. Overheating, cause by excessive cranking, will seriously damage the
starter.</p>

<h2>Shim Setup</h2>

<p class="warn">Warning: Some starter's uses a shim and some do not.</p>

<p class="warn">Warning: Some new/upgraded starters have bigger shafts. This method was writen for older units w/o gear drive. Not sure? Then use GM method if starter doesn't includes right gauge.</p>

<h3>Why or needs a shim...</h3>
<p>Shimming is to address "Tolerance stacking" (Google that...) Starter, engine, flywheel as have +/- tolerance. Sometime all are on plus, all minus, but most are a mix.</p>

<p>If you use a shim, Do Not assumes that the old starter's shim setup is not
automatically uses by the new starter or when Flywheel is switch/replace.</p>

<p>Example:<br>
Old starter = 1 shim<br>
New starter = no shim, 1/2 shim, or 1 1/2 shim, etc.</p>

<p>If engine have a Shim now then you can start with that but <strong>Always use a gauge to test clearance.</strong></p>

<h3>Shim use</h3>

<p>The correct starter clearance for traditional &quot;2 bolt&quot; GM starters
is 1/8 inch between the starter motor shaft and a flywheel tooth pointing
directly at the starter shaft. (Rotate the flywheel as needed to make that
happen.) This method is recommend by starter marker/rebuilder. </p>

<p>You check the clearance with a section of 1/8-inch wire or a drill bit.
(Drill bit must not be chuck chewed from being run loose)</p>

<p><img width="405" height="288" src="startershim/image001.gif"></p>

<p>To increase starter clearance, insert a whole shim between the starter and
engine.</p>

<p>To decrease starter clearance, cut a shim in half and place the half shim on
the outboard bolt.</p>

<p>Shims for GM starters are standard items available at most parts stores.</p>

<h3>GM method</h3>

<p>From GM 88 Fiero SM, Section 6D2, Starter Noise... (Any SM is same. Shim and
how it's use doesn&#8217;t change.)</p>

<p class="quote"><img width="303" height="261" src="startershim/image002.gif" align="right" hspace="12">Disconnect negative battery cable to prevent cranking of engine.</p>

<p class="quote">Check pinion to flywheel clearance, as shown in Fig. 3, by using a wire gage
of .5 mm (.020 in) minimum thickness (or diameter). <i>Center a pinion tooth
between two flywheel teeth and gage, as shown in Fig. 3. Do not gage in the
corners, where a misleading larger dimension may be observed.</i> [Orge add Italics, See Note] If the clearance
is under this minimum, shimming the starter away from the flywheel is required.</p>

<p class="quote">If the clearance is grossly over .5 mm (.020 in) in the vicinity of 1.5 mm
(.060 in) or more, shimming the starter toward the flywheel is required. (This
is generally the problem causing broken flywheel teeth or starter housing.)
Shimming the starter toward the flywheel can be accomplished by shimming only
the outboard starter mounting pad. A shim of .4 mm (.015 in) thickness, at this
location will decrease the clearance by approximately .3 mm (.010 in).</p>

<p>Note: Unless you are an octopus, this is very easy to screw it up. Please use the other method instead.</p>

<h2>Starter Upgrade</h2>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181122/http://www.fiero.nl/forum/Archives/Archive-000001/HTML/20120111-2-108710.html" target="_blank">Try
here.</a> Good upgrade for all Fiero OE engine Is for V6 but Should work on L4 and engine swaps.</p>
