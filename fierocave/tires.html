<h1>Roll This.....</h1>

<h2>Proper Inflation</h2>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181139/http://www.tiresafety.com/maintenance.asp" target="_blank">Read this article</a> at 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181139/http://www.tiresafety.com/" target="_blank">Tire Safety.</a>
It covers most of it. (See Also, the FMVSS data about inflation pressure below.)</p>

<h2>Best Handling</h2>

<p>Make sure all your rims match!!!!! This is critical, especially on an older
car. The odds are very good someone has replaced a rim and even if they look
the same cosmetically they might have different offset, width or even diameter.
This is a common problem when Aluminum wheels that look alike are pulled from
another model car. It is even more common with steel wheels. I have seen cars
that had 4 different rims on them.</p>

<p>I always prefer 4 identical tires on a car. For any normal driving this is
your best handling unless the carmaker specified an uneven front to rear size
setup. Some people want the uneven setup because of a bigger engine. Either way
you want to match brand and type all around even if your run two sizes.</p>

<p>Make sure you have proper inflation. Always start at the original tire
pressure! (I think it's 30-PSI for all Fiero tires.) For regular driving the OE
pressure should work for any tire that will fit the car.</p>

<p>Tires have changed quite allot and If you are driving hard or auto crossing,
you may need to tweak the inflation up or down a couple PSI to find the best
tuning. The way radial tires are built just one or two PSI change can have a
significant difference. Even a fraction or a PSI can make a difference so make
sure you have a really good tire gauge.</p>

<h2>I want more grip!</h2>

<p>When you check tire specs, check the actual tread width. The Section Width,
three-digit part of the tire size, is not the Tread Width and there is quite a
bit of variation from one tire to the next, even when published tire size is
the same! I've seen an inch or more range of tread width for some sizes. </p>

<p>If you have a narrow treaded 195 you can get more tread just by picking a
different 195. Don't just assume that a 205 or even 215 gives you a big tread
increase over a 195. It is actually possible to see 195 with the same tread
width as a larger tire. (Allot of sizes overlap like this.)</p>

<p>Depending just what tires are involved, you might not gain any thing or you
may only have a fractionally larger tread patch on the road. Tread patch is
mostly determined by rolling diameter, tread width, and inflation pressure.
(Ignoring wrinkle wall tires for now.)</p>

<h2>Mounting Wider or Narrower Tires</h2>

<p><b>Note:</b> Just because a wider tire fits, don't assume you will get better
handling. You can actually make things worse. It all depends on the tires and
how the car is setup. This just explains some of what to watch when fitting a
tire to a rim.</p>

<p>Before you plan on installing a non-stock tire, check the tire maker's web
sites or catalogs. They list the range of rim width they recommend for a given
tire. This is fairly important, as some tire designs and vendors are less
tolerant of rims that are too wide or narrow.</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">If the
     rim is out of spec too narrow the tire won't be stable no matter how wide
     it is. (This is a really common problem.)</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">If the
     rim is too wide and you'll roll on the sidewalls allot or the tire will
     wear like it has low air pressure.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Mounting
     the tires on an out of spec rim can void the warranty and road hazard
     coverage. </li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Many
     tire places will not install tires on out of spec rims for legal and
     insurance reasons.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some examples from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181139/http://www.coopertire.com/" target="_blank">Cooper</a>.

<p>The &quot;measured on rim,&quot; or &quot;Meas. Rim Width&quot; as Cooper
lists it, is the rim used to determine the tires published size data. Notice
the different specs for the three 195/70s even though they are the same size. </p>

<p>All the tires above are approved on a 6-inch rim except the 235. Some brands
of 215 or 225 may also be out of spec on a 6-inch rim.</p>

<h2>The &quot;real&quot; effect of alternate tire sizes on Speedometers</h2>

<p>Many people will say that speedometer error caused by changing tire sizes
doesn't matter. They say, &quot;Oh, it's only X% off. So what???&quot; I used
to think that, and then after I did the gear ratio article I wondered what else
was screwed up.</p>

<p>Note: This article assumes you are starting from 195/75R14 for all
calculations. If your car originally came with 13&quot; or 15&quot; tires,
you'll need to adjust the numbers. This article assumes you car has the
original speedometer gears for the tires it came with.</p>

<h3>Smaller Tires</h3>

<p>It's fairly common to drop the profile one number to get a stiffer tire.
I've done this many times. Last time I bought tires, I changed from 195/75R14
to 195/70R14. Like allot of people, I didn't figure it would make much
difference. Let's see...</p>

<p>Most people only look at the speedometer, forgetting completely about other
things. The Miata.net tire calculator says my speedometer is now reading 3% too
fast or at 60 you're doing 58.2 MPH. No big deal there. Reading fast is better
than slow. At least I won't get a ticket with it.</p>

<p>The effect on Gear Ratio we've covered already, 3% doesn't make much dif
here either. So what's left?</p>

<p>Well, the one everyone overlooks is the Odometer. It's now off as well. What
this means is that for every mile my Odometer says I've gone, I've actually
traveled 158.4 feet less than that. This means for every 33.3 (rounded) miles
the Odometer says I drive, the car has actually moved 1 mile less.</p>

<p>The part that stinks is the car is doing nearly the same work as it would
but getting less distance. Example: If, using the Odometer reading, the car
get's 27 highway MPG with OE tires, and the car still says it gets the same
with the slightly smaller tire, the fact is that I've actually lost almost 1
MPG. Over the life of a set of good tires, that's a significant amount of extra
fuel burned.</p>

<p>Or, if we simply take 27 x .03 we get .81 miles lost.</p>

<p>Figure many tires last 40,000 miles or more...</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0pt" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">40,000
     x .03 = 1200 missing miles</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">60,000
     x .03 = 1800 missing miles</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">80,000
     x .03 = 2400 missing miles</li>
</ul>

<p>That &quot;insignificant&quot; 3% change has/will cost me about 44 gallons
of fuel spread over just 40,000 miles. (1200 missing miles / 27 MPG = 44.44)
That's more than 4 tanks of fuel. I can drive back and forth to work for a
month on that much fuel. It rapidly gets worse if you get lower MPG, like
constant city driving. Just dropping to 25MPG will hit you for 48 gallons.
Dropping to 20MPG, where many V6's hang out, costs 60 gallons more fuel.</p>

<h3>Larger tires?</h3>

<p>For one or more reasons, many people go to larger tires... So lets say you
were 3% the other way, reading slower than you are actually moving. For
example: 195/75R14 to 205/70/15. Miata.net says the error is 3.1% slow and
speedometer reads 60 but your going 61.8. I rounded to 3%. No big deal here,
it's not enough to trip most speed traps.</p>

<p>You <i>may</i> gain MPG, but loose torque to the ground just like the Gear
Ratio article says. You also cover more ground than the Odometer reads. So for
40,000 miles of Odometer reading, you'd actually have driven 1200 miles
farther. (Depending on the exact tire involved, you could actually loose MPG.
City MPG would likely be hit more than Highway. In this case I mean real MPG
not what you'd get using the Odometer.)</p>

<p>2-2.5 is a pretty reasonable/common range of change. If you change the tire
diameter by 2.4 inches, the speedometer is now reading 9.1% too slow. You're
reading 60 but the car is moving 65.5. (195/75R14 to 215/70R16)</p>

<p>A 3.4&quot; increase in diameter, easily done with 17&quot; and larger
rim/tire combinations, results in a whopping 13.1% error. Now you're reading
60, but doing nearly 70! (67.8)</p>

<p>Unless they are feeling picky for some reason, the police often won't waste
time on someone doing 2-3 MPH over the speed limit. They are after the people
who are clearly blowing off the limit because it means more points and bigger
fines. </p>

<p>So using our 13.1% example at a common highway speed limit... If the speed
limit is 65, and that's what your speedometer says, you're actually doing
73.5MPH, more than 5 over the limit. If you're like many people who commonly
run a few miles over on the speedometer, at 70 you're doing 79.2, clearly more
than 10 over the limit. </p>

<p>Even at our more conservative 9.1% error, at 65 you'd be doing 70.9. That's
still 5 over the limit and enough to be a ticket magnet in allot of places.</p>

<h3>Now what?</h3>

<p>For these reasons your best choice if you want lower tires, with minimal
change of tire circumference, change from the 14&quot; to a 15&quot; or
16&quot; tire with lower sidewalls. According to the Miata.net calculator, the
following combinations are really close to the OE 14&quot; tire. (I don't know
if they really exist. They'll at least give you an idea. Use the Miata.net
calculator to compare your tires before you buy them.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">205/65R15 Error = 0.1% too fast (Read 60, do 59.9)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">205/60R16 Error = 0.7% too slow (Read 60, do 60.4)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">215/55R16 Error = 0.8% too fast (Read 60, do 59.5)</p>

<p>What this also means is that if you are going to run tires with a
significantly larger circumference, you really should consider recalibrating
the speedometer. This adds to the expense of replacing the tires, but it could
save you a fortune in fines and increased insurance rates.</p>

<h3>Final Note</h3>

<p>If you've done something like installed an AOD transmission, which I
understand some people have gotten from minivans, you want to note what tires
were used on the donor. If the van used a big 15&quot; tire, you could likely
change your Fiero tires to something with the same rolling diameter. This would
actually correct your speedometer if your Fiero has 14&quot; wheels. Same thing works for putting a GT
transmission into a coupe. (Many GT's have 15&quot; wheels and thus different
speedometer gears in the transmission.)</p>

<h2>Hub Centric Vs. Lug Centric</h2>

<p>Hub centric mean the wheel will center using Hub/axle as a reference. Most
OE Wheels are Hub Centric. Most Aftermarket Wheels need adapter rings to use the hub as center reference. </p>

<p>Lug centric mean the wheel will center using Lugs as a reference. This
method works well but has rules...</p>

<p>In Lug Centric method: </p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Need Cone lugs. (Turner lugs and Lugs w/ washer might not work.)</li>
<li>Wheel must not see any load while mounting.</li>
<li>Torque lugs by hand using a torque wrench.</li>
</ul> 

<p>Cone's are self centering only when wheel don't see any load... Loading the wheel, like dropping the jack to stop wheel spinning when torquing lugs, cause lugs bolts to slightly bend and other interference.</p>

<p>Torqueing need three steps at minimum: All lugs hand tight in star pattern,
torque 50ft/lb in star pattern, then torque to spec in star pattern. (Lugs too
tight to fit fingers? Starting torque sequence with a wrench is ok but be
carefully.)</p>

<h3>Aftermarket locks:</h3>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181139/http://www.mcgard.com/" target="_blank">McGard</a> have
styles of locks that fit Fiero studs that might better match aftermarket
wheels. Notice as part number
24012 is <b>NOT</b> compatible with OE Fiero Wheels and lug caps. </p>

<p.quote>This (24012) lock will not fit OEM plastic lug caps. Matching lock can only be
purchased from GM Dealer. <br> Source: McGard</p>

<p>There are several other brands of locks running around. Shop
them carefully. Most are poorly made and rust easily. They can often strip and leave
you completely stranded.</p>

<h2>FMVSS Data</h2>

<p>I've added this because of a huge debate over certain terms, like the
maximum inflation pressure you see on the sidewall. Here are the official
definitions of those terms.</p>

<p class="quote">&sect; 571.109 Standard No. 109; New pneumatic tires.</p>

<p class="quote">S3. Definitions.</p>

<p class="quote"><i>Maximum permissible inflation pressure</i> means the maximum
cold inflation pressure to which a tire may be inflated.</p>

<p class="quote"><i>Load rating</i> means the maximum load a tire is rated to
carry for a given inflation pressure.</p>

<p class="quote"><i>Maximum load rating</i> means the load rating at the maximum
permissible inflation pressure for that tire.</p>

<p class="quote"><i>Section width</i> means the linear distance between the
exteriors of the sidewalls of an inflated tire, excluding elevations due to
labeling, decoration, or protective bands.</p>

<p>This part is just for reference. It explains the FMVSS requirements for nearly
all the labels you see on the side of the tire.</p>

<p class="quote">S4.3 Labeling Requirements. Except as provided in S4.3.1 and
S4.3.2, each tire shall have permanently molded into or onto both sidewalls, in
letters and numerals not less than 0.078 inches high, the information shown in
paragraphs S4.3 (a) through (g). On at least one sidewall, the information
shall be positioned in an area between the maximum section width and bead of
the tire, unless the maximum section width of the tire falls between the bead
and one-fourth of the distance from the bead to the shoulder of the tire. For
tires where the maximum section width falls in that area, locate all required
labeling between the bead and a point one-half the distance from the bead to the
shoulder of the tire. However, in no case shall the information be positioned
on the tire so that it is obstructed by the flange or any rim designated for
use with that tire in Standards Nos. 109 and 110 (&sect; 571.109 and &sect; 571.110 of
