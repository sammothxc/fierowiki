<h1>4 Cylinder Timing Gears </h1>

<p class="warn">NOTICE! This is an unfinished document. It is a collection of all
the stuff I've come up with tested or not... USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK! </p>

<h2>Anywho...</h2>

<p>Cam jobs suck under the best of conditions. The majority of FWD and Fiero
cams are never fun to work on. Here's a collection of stuff I've gathered up
that should help.</p>

<p>One item that surprised me... GM actually built the 87+ 4 cylinders with a
simple steel crank pulley. As cheap as GM is, that one was still surprising.
Harmonic balancers are usually considered a critical part of the crank set. The
good news is they did revise the parts list and you can get a real harmonic
balancer for them. </p>

<p>I'm working on methods for changing the cam pulley using common tools. I've
included that material here even though it's only in the development phase. I
figure there's enough there that more advanced people can use or adapt it as
needed. I'm sure there is some kink in it that still needs a good beating.</p>

<p>Back On Holiday has posted a large number of pictures he shot while doing
his timing set.</p>

<p>I recommend a new thrust plate anytime the gears are replaced. A crappy
thrust plate isn't going to help your new gears any. For less than $6 it's
cheap insurance.</p>

<p>It appears that the newer thrust plates have added holes to help with oil
distribution in the hub area. I don't know if the hole in the oil gallery plug
is still needed with the new thrust plate. I tend to lean toward adding the
hole because it should also get more oil to the gear teeth. I don't think the
revised thrust plate would help that.</p>

<h2>Revised Parts</h2>

<p>Quite some time ago, GM changed the timing gear numbers from individual
parts to mated sets. If your 22P book or other old list shows them as separate
parts, those numbers are invalid. Always replace the timing gears as a set no
matter where you get them! The crank gear may look ok but even subtle wear can
cause a problem with a new cam gear.</p>

<p>GM revised the crank pulley on later model 2.5l. The original is simply a
steel pulley with no harmonic balancer function. In Fiero this applies to the
87-88 4 cyl. I've also included the U VIN version of the 4 cyl for those that
may have acquired one thru an engine swap. [My notes in square brackets]</p>

<p class="quote">&quot;It is also recommended that a crankshaft torsional damper
[AKA Harmonic Balancer] be installed along with the [timing] gear set. The
damper reduces critical crankshaft vibrations thereby decreasing [gear set]
wear. When the new damper is installed, the old crankshaft pulley may be
discarded. If the engine already has a damper, it should be reinstalled.&quot;</p>

<p>Source: GM TSB 90-6-21, Dated 02/90, Servicing Camshaft/Crankshaft Gears
(Install Torsional Damper)</p>

<p>I've given both the GM timing set number and the damper number. I don't know
what the damper costs from the dealer. I have found it in inventory for the 87+
R motors, so it's still out there. I've also listed 3 third party replacements
at the end of this page.</p>

<p>Harmonic Balancers are just plain good for the motor. They reduce timing
gear and crank bearing wear and may give slight improvements to fuel economy
and HP. Installing the new balancer is strongly recommended.</p>
<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>I've installed a balancer. (8/14, Old pulley was worn and the seal was leaking.)</p>

<p>Pulley/Balancer center Bolt is torque to 100 ft/lbs.</p>

<p>Dorman and others sells harmonic balancer without standard puller holes. The
unthreaded holes are drill to take 1/2 bolts. If you email Dorman, their &quot;support&quot;
won't help you.</p>

<p>If you need to pull the balancer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get 3 Bolts, 1/2&quot; Coarse thread, 3-4 inches long.</li>

<li>Tap the holes with 1/2&quot; Coarse Tap. If tapping is done after install, note
that a normal Tap will hit the Timing Cover and the hole can have tight threads
at bottom. (If needed a 1/2-13 bottoming tap will help to thread after install.
Problem is that Bottoming Taps are harder to start the threading operation for
most people.)</li>

<li>Often can't find a puller will take 1/2 bolts. You need to grind open a bit of each
slot. I used Dremel tool with 932 Aluminum oxide grinding stone. (This also means
you need to BUY a puller. Loners/rentals do not like you to mod the tool.) The
puller is still good but you need heavy washers so that normal bolts can't go
thru if you hit fat areas later.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the balance is tight then load up the puller and carefully hit each bolt on
the head. Expect 1/8-1/4 turn of puller screw to start with. Don't beat them!
Just vibrate the balancer to get it to move. Load up the puller again and repeat.
First time can take awhile. Is easier with 2-3 pound hammer and just bump the
bolts. After you do this a few time, the puller will finish without hitting. (Don't
hit the balancer itself! You can wreck it.)</p>

<h2>Fiber (Phenolic) vs. Metal Cam Gear</h2>

<p>There is a ton of debate over replacing the Phenolic cam gear with a solid
metal one. While many people say a solid metal gear is better, I have my
doubts.</p>

<p>Here are a few things to think about...</p>

<p>Various types of composite gears have been used in timing sets since at
least the mid 60's that I've seen. They may go back further than that. My 1968
289 Ford motor had a nylon tooth driven gear in it's chain set. There's allot
of well-established technology behind using these gears in the Fiero motors.</p>

<p>The original Phenolic cam gear is lasting well over 100,000 miles and a
dozen or more years in most cases. The odds are good the next one will outlast
the rest of the engine and for many people, the rest of the car. </p>

<p>If you think 100,000 miles is too short a service life, consider that most
timing belts in other motors have to be replaced at 40,000-mile intervals. Such
belts are often as difficult or worse to replace than the &quot;Iron Duke&quot;
timing set.</p>

<p>If/when the timing set fails in this motor; there is no significant damage
to the engine. This is much different from many other motors where timing set
failure can literally destroy the engine. Such &quot;Interference Engines&quot;
are known for snapping valves and driving them thru the head block or pistons.</p>

<p>Phenolic gears have inherently smoother teeth than metal gears and generally
stay that way over their life. This is another factor that allows tighter tooth
clearance than metal on metal. Remember, gear teeth are by nature also bearing
surfaces. The smoother they are, the less friction they develop. </p>

<p>Metal gears are prone to galling if tolerances become excessively tight or
they aren't getting plenty of oil. This can result in sloppy timing or even
gear failure. </p>

<p>Part of your decision should probably include which engine setup is in the
car. Flat tappets will put more loads on the cam than Roller lifters will and
that might shorten the life of the Phenolic gear. </p>

<p>The distributor will also increase cam gear load. Even in the distributor
motors the Phenolic gear has been lasting 100,000 miles or more. In most cases,
by the time the motor wears out a second gear it's going to need a full
rebuild.</p>

<p>Some people have indicated metal may be more noisy. If the gears are well
made this should not be much of an issue. This is a helical cut gear. Such
gears have more than one tooth in contact at any given time. This makes the
transition from tooth to tooth much smoother than with straight cut gears.</p>

<h2>What kills the gears?</h2>

<p>Obviously simple wear is a big factor. The lack of a harmonic balancer on
some versions of L4 could also be an issue.</p>

<p>As originally installed the gears apparently don't get a large amount of
oil. GM recommends a change to improve gear oiling. I strongly recommend that
change be done. As I understand this, the only oil the gears get normally is
whatever runs from the cam and crank bearings. The change punches a small hole
in an oil gallery plug to get more oil to the gears.</p>

<p>Frequency of oil changes and choice of oil are also likely factors in this.
If the gears are running a little dry to start with then crappy oil won't help
any. </p>

<p>Running heavier oil than specified could also be a problem. Heavier oil
could increase oil pump load on the cam and reduce oil to the cam and gears at
the same time.</p>

<p>When the cam gear fails other items to watch out for are the oil pump and,
in the older motors, the distributor. Make sure you check both items when
changing the gears. If either or both are binding then you could be overloading
the cam gears. Installation of metal gears may only hide such a problem until
the offending part(s) fail completely.</p>

<p>The endplay on the gears is also important. Too much and the cam could
wander in the bore. Too little could make the cam bind. This item is very
important to watch when changing gears.</p>

<h2>Do I need to remove the oil pan?</h2>

<p>NOTE: To clarify, Yes, I think you should probably drop the pan. Besides
cleaning it out, you can check for pump problems before they kill the new
gears, or worse. Interestingly, the GM gear change TSB doesn't require this. </p>

<p>It's a good idea but I don't think most people do it. Also depends some on
just how much was chewed from the gear. </p>

<p>Since the engine quits as soon as the cam gear does, allot of the waste is
probably sitting right below the gear. Once the cam and crank gears are off you
can probably get most of it out that way. </p>

<p>The big pieces of phenolic tend to sink to the bottom of the pan and sit
there but if you think you've got allot of small particles you may want to do
the pan.</p>

<p>At the very least, I'd change the oil after you fix the gears. You could use
some kerosene to wash stuff into the sump that you can't get out by the crank.
Changing the oil should remove anything that floats. </p>

<p>I also recommend a magnetic oil plug to help grab any metal from the drill
and tap operations that may escape the rag. (I always run a magnetic plug.
Whatever it catches is that much less that passes thru the oil pump.) </p>

<h2>Do I need to remove anything else?</h2>

<p>Disconnect the battery cable(s), and if needed the dog bone. You don't want
to risk tugging the battery if you drop the motor any. The dog bone has to be
loose to drop the cradle or remove the motor mount.</p>

<p>You may want to take out the strut and hub assembly to gain workroom. As
long as you don't separate the hub from the strut you should not need an
alignment much if at all when you are finished.</p>

<p>You'll probably want the mud skirt removed.</p>

<p>You can gain a couple inches by removing the motor mount. Just make sure you
don't rest the motor on the crank pulley. This may give you enough room for
that you don't need to drop the cradle. </p>

<p>To remove the motor mount, I reach in from the wheel well to get the top
nuts. You can get one nut with a socket wrench but the other doesn't have room.
I use a 15mm flare fitting or box end wrench on that one. These are locknuts so
they are going to be tight all the way off and back on.</p>

<p>You can gain more room by dropping the back of the cradle a little. </p>

<h2>Remove and Install</h2>

<p>Whenever the timing set is replaced, replace the crank seal while the timing
cover is off. If the sealing area of the existing pulley or balancer is scored,
replace it or install a repair sleeve. (Clean all parts with alcohol or brake
parts cleaner before installing the repair sleeve.)</p>

<p>Always replace the crank seal when installing a new damper!</p>

<h3>Modified GM in car method </h3>

<p class="note">Please Note: This procedure should be considered &quot;under
development.&quot; Until I can obtain a test cam and gear, or (GAG!) my gear
fails, I can't test this. So while it should work, and it is based on a GM TSB,
I just don't have all the facts. </p>

<p>Based on a method originally published in GM TSB 88-6-62 dated 6/88, this version has been modified to
allow common tools. (<a href="camgrear-TSB-88-6-52.pdf" target="_blank">GM TSB 88-6-62 dated 6/88      here.</a> )</p>

<h4>The logic behind this</h4>

<p>GM's method uses two 1/4&quot;-28 bolts threaded into the metal hub very
close to the cam and the PFKB method farther down appears to thread the access
holes in the cam gear. I don't see why a standard puller, used in close to or
even partly biting the hub should be any problem. (The big holes allow access
to the thrust plate that keeps the cam in place)</p>

<p>The Lisle steering wheel puller may even allow you to use GM's recommended
pulling bolt size and locations. You'll probably need washers for the bolt
heads. GM has you start the holes with a small bit, enlarge them to the tap
bit, and tap to 1/4&quot;-28 with a blind tap. I forget how deep the holes are
supposed to be. They don't go all the way thru.</p>

<p>The most important item is making sure GM guidelines are followed for the
cam hole. If the hole is too deep you could weaken the cam. Too shallow and you
may not have enough bite to press on the new gear.</p>

<h4>Things you need</h4>

<p>This procedure requires a high-quality steering wheel puller such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150827000715/http://www.lislecorp.com/" target="_blank">Lisle's</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150827000715/http://www.lislecorp.com/tool_detail.cfm?detail=873" target="_blank">#
45000.</a> Cheap pullers may be destroyed in this application. You may be able
to use a small harmonic balancer puller. (Lisle's puller lists for $16.95. How
much cheaper can you get and still have a good tool?) Don't forget to oil the
puller's drive bolt before you start! (This version assumes you will use the
Lisle 45000 puller. If you use a different puller you may need a different
drill and tap to match your draw bolts.)</p>

<h4>The Lisle 45000 puller contains the following parts:</h4>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">45020 Puller Screw </span><br>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">45050 Screw Pad </span><br>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">45090 Puller Frame </span><br>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">(2) Washers </span><br>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">(2) 45200 3/8&quot; - 16 Bolt </span><br>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">(2) 45210 5/16&quot; - 18 Bolt </span><br>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt">(2) 45220 5/16&quot; - 24 Bolt</span></p>

<p>If you can't find Lisle tools at your local parts stores, try Sears. My area
Sears had a bunch of Lisle stuff in stock when I was there last. (Don't go by
Lisle's dealer list. Allot of parts stores buy from jobbers and often aren't
listed by Lisle.)</p>

<h4>You'll also need:</h4>

<p>A 3/8&quot;-16 &quot;Bottoming&quot;, AKA &quot;Blind,&quot; tap and it's
matching drill bit. Good taps nearly always have the required drill size
engraved on them. (Unlike a regular tap, a bottoming/blind tap will cut threads
all the way to the bottom of a hole that is closed or doesn't have enough
clearance behind it.)</p>

<p>A smaller bit, like 1/8 inch, used to drill starter holes may also be
helpful. </p>

<p>Some 3/8&quot;-16 threaded rod and a matching nut. (A bolt with long enough
threaded length and matching nut will also work.) Consider a Grade 8 hardened
rod/bolt for this. (Class 10.9 if your using Metric stuff.)</p>

<p>A 1mm (.040 inch) drill bit.</p>

<p>A dial gauge with suitable mount.</p>

<h4>The process</h4>

<p class="note">NOTE: The hole in the cam MUST NOT exceed 1/2 inch deep! That
holes dimensions are very important and were determined by GM to leave the cam
strong enough to accept the new gear and not break later. Use depth stops or at
least tape on the drill bits to prevent going too deep. The hole in the cam may
be easier if you first drill a smaller pilot hole.</p>

<p>Drill and tap all three holes before removing the cam gear. This will help
keep trash away from the cam bearings. Be careful drilling thru the gear. Slide
some sheet metal behind the gear to protect anything you may hit with the
drill. Rotate the gear so you aren't drilling over the cam thrust plate! </p>

<p>Take your time tapping the holes. It may be easier to use a standard tap to
start the hole and follow it with the blind tap to finish. A regular tap
definitely won't give enough thread in the cam hole.</p>

<p><img src="l4cam/image003.gif" align="left">Stuff
rags into the oil pan to collect waste from drilling and tapping. (A single
large rag is best.)</p>

<p>Use the scribe lines to drill and tap two holes in the cam gear. Get them in
close to the gear's hub. The phenolic is strong but you want as much grip as
possible for the draw bolts. (Make sure you don't get so close the drill or tap
will hit the cam!) This may be easier if you drill pilot holes first with a
small bit. If you hit the metal hub, that's ok. It'll just give more strength
to pull against. </p>

<p>Drill and tap a hole in the center of the cam.</p>

<p><img src="l4cam/image005.gif"></p>

<p>Install the puller. Cover the hole in the cam to protect the threads! (If
you can't use the screw pad that comes with the puller then use washers or
coins.)</p>

<p>Slowly pull off the gear. </p>

<h4>While the gear is off...</h4>

<p>(This is from the same TSB with the gear replacement instructions.)</p>

<p>GM recommends that a 1mm (.040 inch) hole be drilled in an oil gallery plug
to improve gear oiling. I DO NOT know exactly where this gallery plug is! The
hole can be smaller but must not be bigger than specified! (Later versions of
L4 may already have this hole.) </p>

<h4>Install the new gear</h4>

<p>Use some large washers with the threaded rod and nut to press on the new
gear AFTER installing the crank gear. Oil the threads before you press the
gear. <b>Make sure the timing marks are lined up!</b></p>

<p>Set up the dial gauge so it touches the end of the cam. Per the GM TSB, the
cam should have .0015 to .0050 (inch) of end play with the gear installed.</p>

<p>Make sure all the rags are removed from the oil pan and install the timing
cover, balancer, etc.</p>

<h3>Yet another Method</h3>

<p class="note">This one is just a theory. As long as you're very careful there's
no reason it can't be done like this. There are loads of variations possible
here. This is the one idea I was playing with recently.</p>

<p>It should also be possible to &quot;crack&quot; the cam hub for removal.
This could give you a way out if no pullers are available. Someone mentioned
grinding in a forum thread... I would not do that. Grinding or power saws would
likely throw stuff everywhere.</p>

<p>To install the new gear you will still need the hole in the cam, etc. (As
described above.)</p>

<p>To do this use a fine drill bit to drill a series of holes in the hub. Drill
the holes so they are about 1/8 to 3/16 inch from each other. Exact distance
will vary some depending on which bits you choose to use. (Fine bits are easier
to control.)</p>

<p class="warn">WARNING! Make sure you do not drill over/into the thrust plate!
Use a depth stop to make sure the drill can't hit any thing behind the gear.
Use a piece of sheet metal to shield the area behind the gear. Adjust the stop
as needed to prevent drill contact with the cam, bearing or block! You've got
to be very careful drilling the holes near the cam!</p>

<p>It seams like allot of holes at first but you save a bunch by making use of
the access holes cast into the cam. (The holes let you get at the thrust plate
bolts during cam removal.) The gear itself is fairly soft so drilling those
holes should go pretty fast. </p>

<p>Drill the first hole close to the cam and the rest straight out from it. The
holes don't have to be perfectly straight. Make sure you don't hit the cam with
the drill. (You may need 2 rows of holes like this.) Once the little holes are
done, use a larger bit to connect as many of the small holes as possible.</p>

<p><img src="l4cam/image007.gif"></p>

<p>The fiber is actually covering part of the metal core. You'll need to make
the line of holes reach at least to one of the access holes molded in the gear.
You may have to go all the way to one side of the gear.</p>

<p>Once you've made a line of holes and enlarged then as indicated, use sheet
metal screws/bolts to spread the crack. Work from the outside of the gear
toward the core. (You want pointed screws not tapping or drill tip screws.)</p>

<h2>In car cam removal</h2>

<p>By dropping the rear of the cradle, it is possible to remove the cam without
pulling the motor. A number of people have done the gear change that way. There
are several accounts of this in the forums. Be extremely careful that you don't
damage a cam bearing when extracting or inserting the cam.</p>

<p>In car cam removal is pretty tricky. I'd strongly recommend you try one of
the other methods. Disturbing a used cam can have unpredictable results on high
mileage motors. Make sure all lifters and pushrods are returned to their
original locations. Put nylon wire ties on the pushrods before you remove them
so you know which end goes up later. Buy or make a tray to keep everything in
order.</p>

<p>You may need to remove the alternator and/or intake manifold to get enough
room to work on the lifters. The rest of the procedure is essentially the same
as published in Haynes etc.</p>

<p>There is an advantage to cam removal... It allows full inspection of the cam
and lifters. This would be more important to flat tappet setups than rollers.
It's not at all uncommon for flat tappets to wear cam lobes completely flat.</p>

<h2>Other Info</h2>

<p>Third party damper sources for 87+ VIN R, replaces 10101369.</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Damper Dudes PO151-1N</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Dorman 594-027</p>
  <p class="MsoNormal">Pioneer DA-151</p>

<p>Even though Damper Dudes is new, they also rebuild them so they want the old
ones. That could be a problem since many people only have a steel pulley, not a
damper.</p>

<p>Autozone only sells new dampers. I'd recommend new because you also know the
pulley is fresh. A worn pulley won't help belt life... Serpents can be a big
enough pain without adding an iffy pulley.</p>
