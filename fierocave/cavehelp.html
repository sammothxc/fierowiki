<h1>Help!</h1>
<p>This page should cover the few things that people have sent me email
about...</p>
<h2>I can't see the main menu.</h2>
<p>The main menu should be located in the left panel above "Roam To:"
If you cannot see it or some of the other cave navigation tools don't
work, you
likely have one of the following issues...</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="1" type="1">
  <li>You have disabled Java and/or Java Scripting on your computer.
Turn on Java, Java Script or fix/reinstall your browser.</li>
  <li>You are running Windoze XP or another Operating System that
doesn't have the Java Virtual Machine installed. Microsloth shipped
early versions of XP without Java support. Install one of the following
updates... (You must be logged into the machine with administrator
privileges to install either.)</li>
  <ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="1" type="a">
    <li>Visit "Windows Update" on your Start Menu and download the
current Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</li>
    <li>Visit <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050322233746/http://java.sun.com/" target="_blank">Sun's
Java Site</a> and download the current Java Runtime Engine (JRE)</li>
  </ol>
  <li>You are using a browser with know problems. Example, WebTV does
not work properly with JavaScript. (That is why they are pushed to a
limited menu.) I have not scripted things to any specific browser.
Update your browser or use a different one.</li>
  <li>You are Using Firefox. After installing the Sun JVM you may need
to open Firefox and under Tools menu, Options, Web Features, and check
Enable Java. This seems to be turned off by default in some Firefox
versions.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Other operating systems, Mac, Linux, etc, may also need to
have the
JVM installed or updated. These operating systems may include a JVM but
not
install it by default or they may have included an old version. Sun has
a JRE
package for almost every operating system on the planet.</p>
<p>No, the JVM isn't part of the browser. Think of it along the lines
of having
to download the Flash or Shockwave plug-in. (It's much more than a
plug-in but
you get the idea.)</p>
<h3>The Last Resort</h3>
<p><b>The old menu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050322233746/http://home.sprynet.com/%7Etheogre/tunnel6/indexold.htm" target="_blank">is here.</a></b> I
will not be updating this menu and I know there are broken links on it.
If you
want the most current pages you'll have to fix your browser. I&#8217;m not
planning
any menu system change until there is some sign as to where the Eolas
Patent
Suit will pan out. (See further down.) I don&#8217;t feel like changing it
just to
end up changing it again.</p>
<h3>Why don't I have problems with other sites?</h3>
<p>You probably do but simply haven't noticed. Few sites use a full
Java
program to navigate. Many sites use Java Script, which is part of the
browser.
The only thing Java and Java Script share is the name. They are
otherwise
completely different.</p>
<h3>Why do you use Java?</h3>
<p>Although it takes a bit for some people to get a JVM loaded... It
makes
navigating and managing the site VERY easy. I can now add delete or
reorganize
pages with simple edits to one text file. Keep in mind there are now
over 100
pages in just the Fiero Cave.</p>
<p>Plus as noted above, Sun makes a JVM for just about everything.
Technically
the Java menu could even run on java enabled cell phones and pagers. (I
bet it
would be hard to read...)</p>
<h3>I&#8217;m told Java and Java Script are not safe...</h3>
<p>Like many Microsoft products, the implementations of those items
used by Internet Explorer have many holes.
Use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050322233746/http://www.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">Mozilla</a> with
the Sun JVM and your web surfing will be much safer. Likely faster as
well since Mozilla is far less bloated than IE.</p>
<p>Note: If you install Mozilla after the Sun JVM you will need to
enable
Mozilla in the Sun Java item in Control Panel.</p>
<h3>Advanced Windoze Users:</h3>
<p>Yes, you can have both the Microsoft and Sun JVM installed on the
same
machine. The Sun JVM includes a control panel applet that allows you to
easily
switch the default Java Processor.</p>
<p>I usually run the Sun JVM on all my machines. I only disable it on
the rare
occasion I have to use something written strictly for the labotomized
Microsoft
JVM.</p>
<h2>Some links will not open.</h2>
<p>Note that external links listed on most cave pages open in new
windows.
(popups) If the links don't work it may be because you have popup
blocking
turned on. You will need to adjust your popup blocking settings to
allow these
links to work. (There are no advertising popups anywhere in the Ogre's
Cave.)</p>
<h2>Frame Scroll Covers Menu Items</h2>
<p>The Frame divider is not locked. Grab the divider and drag it as
needed.
(The divider is the vertical border between the menu scroll bar and
right
frame.) </p>
<p>Note that IE often doesn't change to the resize cursor (Two headed
arrows)
when resizing a frame. This is a minor IE issue. You can still resize
the
frame.</p>
<h2>Menu Sound doesn't fire when selecting a book button.</h2>
<p>There is a bug in Sun JVM 1.5.0_01 and maybe latter that is messing
with the sound. I haven't seen any other problems with 1.5. JVM
1.4.2_07 and older works just fine. (Note: If you are using anything
older than 1.4.2_07 you should update ASAP. 1.4.2_07 fixes some
potential security problems.)</p>
<h2>Images</h2>
<p><b>Please Note:</b></p>
<p>As of July 2004... I have
gone thru the cave and all the Vector images should now have GIF/JPG
rollback. I
have tested IE with and without the needed plug-in and it seems to work
both ways.
(I'm still not exactly sure which plug-in is involved with this.)
Mozilla and Netscape
seem to be happy now as well. If you are still having problems with
images I
don't know what is wrong. Make sure you didn't do something like block
images.
(&lt;-- A feature available in Mozilla and IE.)</p>
<p>Also note that some corporate proxies may block files with the WMZ
extension thinking it is used only by Windows Media Player.
If that is the case you need to use another browser or access the cave
from another location.</p>
<p>Many images are formatted as both Bitmap (GIF/JPG) and Vector.
Currently I
believe only IE 5.x and up supports the VML. (They will download as
bitmaps
when VML is not available.) They should display on all browsers,
however when
rendered in VML they cannot easily be copied/pasted. This is a side
effect of
VML, not a bug on the page. </p>
<p>Most of the cave images were created as drawings not bitmaps. The
VML allows
things like scaling of the drawings as needed with better results than
bitmaps.
</p>
<p>Another advantage is that a VML drawing is usually smaller than an
equivalent GIF/JPG bitmap, which means they download faster on dialup
connections. As an example, the VML drawings in the CS alternator
article are
2K each while the GIF versions are 4K each. Similar or greater size
savings are
typical. These seemingly small savings often become very obvious
downloading
pages with several drawings.</p>
<h2>Printing or Print Preview doesn't work right</h2>
<p>IE's Print Preview is a problem with IE. There is nothing I can do
about it.</p>
<p>If you have trouble printing...</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
  <li>Click in the frame you wan to print before clicking the print
button or using menu file/print.</li>
  <li>Right click the frame you want to print and select print in the
popup menu. (Instead of the print button or the file menu.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>W3C Standards vs. Microsloth</h2>
<p>As some forum users have noted, The Fiero Cave, and the rest of the
site, is
written using Microsoft products, mainly Word 2K. As of July, 2004, it
is tested in IE 6.1 and Mozilla 1.7 or later. I don't have time or
energy for exhaustive testing across all
browsers/platforms. That said...</p>
<p>The site is written to conform as closely as I can to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050322233746/http://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C</a> standards for HTML
and CSS. It should render
correctly on all current browsers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I've spent considerable time writing custom Word templates to strip
Microsoft specific formatting from the Fiero Cave. (Some other site
pages are
still rather bloated with MS code.) Most pages have also been run thru
Microsoft Office HTML Filter 2.0 and other things to further strip them
down.</p>
<h2>Page Formatting</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Cable and DSL connections are not
available in
many areas, even heavily populated ones. I've done about everything I
can to
save both server space and download bandwidth. None of these items
should choke
current browsers. </p>
<h3>CSS</h3>
<p>The Cave is formatted with Cascading Style Sheets. All current
browsers
should support CSS. There is little if any IE specific CSS.</p>
<p>If you are using an older browser, get a new one. If you don't like
IE, try <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050322233746/http://www.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">Mozilla</a>.</p>
<p>Older versions of Netscape have known problems supporting CSS.
Upgrade <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050322233746/http://www.netscape.com/" target="_blank">Netscape</a>
or try Mozilla.</p>
<h3>Fonts</h3>
<p>The Cave uses "Trebuchet MS" font on systems that have it. Most
Windoze
machines with MS Office, and/or IE 4 &amp; up, have this font. </p>
<p>Macintosh users with MS office or MS IE may also have this font. (I
don't
know for sure what is in Office/IE for Mac.)</p>
<p>In all other cases, it should render with Helvetica/Ariel headings
and Times
body text. Those are the only fonts I know of that are common to nearly
all
operating systems. They look crappy but everyone has them.</p>
