<h1>Radiator Fail</h1>

<p class="warn">Warning: All automatic transmission owners... Check your
radiator!</p>

<p>Warning sign? Look for the Left plastic tank bowing out alone front and back
flat section over oil cooler. </p>

<p>Even if it not leaking now... It will be soon.</p>

<p>Already leaking? Do not drive the car! You can not fix it. Buy a NEW
radiator or visit a Radiator shop. Used radiator may work for a short time but
you want a New radiator. Uses radiator most likely is weak and be leaking in
short order.</p>

<h2>Manual transmission left radiator tank and right side for both trans</h2>

<p>They can fail too but give less warning. Why? Simple... Round tank is stronger.</p>

<h2>ACDelco Tank Parts</h2>

<p>Yes ACDelco made a Tank you could buy but now discontinues. Maybe some ACDelco
dealers still has old stock and you need a Radiator Shop to install it. (Man
Trans, Left Tank, Part # 3056567. Auto Trans, Left Tank, Part # 3056714.)</p>

<p>Tank gasket will fail but gasket can be fix. ACDelco, and maybe others, made/makes
a gasket. Call a Radiator Shop. (ACDelco Part # 3092236)</p>

<h2>Plastic suck...</h2>

<p>Problem is old age. 20-25 years on tank is very good design, especially the oil
cooler side. Many metal tanks are past there prime too. Fix plastic? Now that
does suck...</p>

<h2>Pictures</h2>

<p>Pictures from my radiator on 4/1/10. April Fool my ass......</p>
