<h1>Blue Dingy Thingy</h1>

<p>I do not recommend people discard the chime box. Doing this has come back to
haunt people. While you may be a careful driver, other people often aren't.
With the exception of the seat belt chime, which I find insulting as well as
annoying, I recommend all other functions be kept intact, especially the hand
brake and headlight warnings. </p>

<ul style="margin-top:0pt" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">The dash lights can be
     obscured by hand and steering wheel position or the light may be out. The
     audible brake warning provides additional driver notification. Yes, people
     have driven around with the hand brake on even with the light glowing,
     which usually results in major rear brake work.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">It is a common practice
     in Fiero to disable the headlight motors in winter to prevent damage to
     the lift system. The headlight switch provides little visual feed back
     that it's on. This makes it really easy to leave the lights on after
     driving in dreary weather unless the chime unit is working. (It's not
     perfect... if the dash dimmer is off/broken the chime won't alert for the
     headlights.)</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">The key warning is a
     toss up. If you want to disable this so you can work in piece, put a
     switch in the control line for that function. Even an experienced driver will
     leave the keys in the switch at times. (Of course this only matters if the
     switch in the steering column works... Many of them don't.)</li>
</ul>


<p>There are 2 reasons people need to mess with the chime
wires. The first is to find the source of a problem the second is to customize
a function. Custom function can be as simple as disabling a tone or replacing a
tone with a new signal. The most common problem is &quot;random tone&quot; which is
extremely annoying. Random Tone is the occurrence of one or two tones at random
times. Since it usually doesn't have any repeatable pattern it's a royal pain
to trace.</p>


<h2>Notes:</h2>
<p>The best way I've found to alter the function of the box is
to remove terminals from the socket. This is a fairly simple process. I do not
recommend cutting the wires. The main reason is you may want to return the box
to stock operation if you sell the car. The other is that in my case I was
mainly trying to determine what line is the source of the &quot;random ding&quot; problem
that's been driving a bunch of people, including me, nuts. This way if the line
I disable doesn't solve the problem I can put it back and try another with no
splicing.</p>


<p>This is likely the last update this article will receive as I have stopped all
work on the chime box. Chime boxes are still available thru GM and AC
Delco. (The part information is at the end of this article.) While at one point
I did look into repairing them, it simply isn't cost effective to offer that
service. Millions of GM vehicles from 1982-1996 used the boxes and new ones
can be found at decent prices thru parts stores that carry AC Delco.</p>

<p>The front of the socket is the side the chime plugs into.
I'm making sure we're all on the same page since the &quot;Front&quot; is pointing to the
right in some cars and down in others.</p>

<p>There is a manufacturing defect in the chime box. See the <a href="#_Defect_Report_1">Defect Report</a> about it farther down. At this time
I believe this defect is the cause of random tones, chimes that sound like they
have static, and most weak or dead chime units.</p>


<h2>Disable a function without cutting wire.</h2>

<p>First drop the socket off its bracket on the heating system.
The ones that face right are held in place by 2 screws. The ones that face down
are held by one screw and the other side is sort of wedged onto an ear on the
bracket. Let the whole thing hang by the wires. Now you'll be able to get to
both sides of the socket easily.</p>
<p>Next remove the white plastic clip on the back of the
socket. There's one clip for the chime and another for the horn relay and
hazard flasher. The clip slides out the side of the socket. (You only need the
chime clip out.)</p>
<p>Look at the clip. Notice that one prong has a notched end.
This side of the clip goes into the hole on the hazard socket side of the chime
connector.</p>
<p>Look at the front side of the socket. Notice how each
terminal opening is notched on one side. To remove the individual terminals
slip a small wire or screwdriver into the notch. That will release the tab that
holds each terminal. You may have to wiggle or pry your release tool a bit just
be careful not to damage anything.</p>
<p>When inserting a terminal make sure it goes in the way it
came out or it won't lock and you won't be able to insert the retaining clip.</p>

<p><a href="chime2.htm#cut" title="Step by Step Images">Step by Step Images</a></p>

<p>When you're finished playing with terminals put the clip
back into the socket. The clip gives added support to the terminals so they
can't pop out when you plug in the chime.</p>



<p>That's about it for the thermals.</p>



<h2>Chime &quot;logic&quot;</h2>



<p>The Chime unit has 5 functions listed in the table below.
The remaining terminals are Main Power, Ground, and a line that is tied to the
ignition switch Run circuit to tell the box if the car is on or off so that it
knows which functions are relevant. (Remember, there are 5 key positions ACC,
Lock, Off, Run, and Start.)</p>

<p>The functions controlled by switches are all activated when
the switches close a path to ground.</p>



<p>The seatbelt warning timer is part of the chime box. The
seatbelt light will always activate for about 10 seconds when the key is turned
to the run position. The seatbelt chime will activate at the same time only if
the driver is not belted. The driver's belt latch has a switch in it to detect
that the belt is buckled. Fiero's wiring doesn't monitor the passenger
seatbelt.</p>



<p>If the seatbelt sense line (line H) is removed from the
chime socket then the seatbelt chime will never sound. The seatbelt light will
still activate each time the key is turned to run.</p>



<p>If the Chime box is unplugged the seatbelt lamp will not
light even in Lamp Test.</p>



<p><b>DO NOT </b>depend on the chime to tell you the key is in
the ignition switch! The contacts of the key sensor in the steering column can
get out of adjustment resulting in unreliable operation of the chime. Some key
cut patterns can also cause intermittent contact of the key sensor. Wear in the
ignition lock can also be an issue with this. Fixing the key sensor or ignition
lock is possible but requires tearing apart the steering column.</p>



<p>If the dimmer for the dash lights is off then you will not get a chime if you leave 
the park/head lights on when you shut off the car. This is how GM chose to wire it. The only reason I can 
think of is when you have to leave the parking lights on. This way you can kill the chime while you pump gas 
or work in/around the car. (It doesn't kill the key buzzer. If the door is open with the key in, the chime will still ring.)
</p>



<p>I don't see any reason to change it but one possibility is to run a new wire from 
the parking light terminal on the headlight switch to the chime. Not exactly easy but it would make sure the chime always activates.
</p>

<h2>Chime and Parking Brake Problem</h2>

<p>Chime unit activating even when touching the brake handle and Key is on? 
<a href="brakerear.htm#light">See here</a> and check brake light in the dash too. 
Bulb is blown or doesn't make solid enough connection to make bulb turn on.
</p>

<h2>The Random Tone Problem</h2>



<p class="note">Note: This section has been left in only for historical value. 
If you are having this problem read the <a href="#_Defect_Report_1">Defect Report</a> farther down this page first.</p>



<p>As I said above this is annoying as hell. Hearing a chime out
of nowhere for no reason really gets on your nerves, especially if it happens
several times during a short trip. The simple fix of pulling the chime isn't
good because it disables everything. For those of us that lock the headlights
up in bad weather this can be a problem because the switch doesn't give you
much of a visual clue that it's on. It looks pretty much the same on or off.</p>



<p>The current definition of the Random Tone problem is 1 or 2
tones sounding at random intervals. The interval can be a few minutes or days.
There has been no evidence of the pattern being repeatable. No one has reported
seeing any of the dash warning lights active when this occurs. In my testing it
does not appear to be related to the hand brake switch since the tones still occur
with the switch disconnected. It doesn't seem to be the chime box itself since
replacement of the box doesn't fix the problem.</p>



<p>That I can tell there are only 2 signal lines that should
cause this, all the other functions seem to be disabled when the key is in the
on position. The seatbelt line could do this if there is a problem with the
seatbelt timer. The other is the brake warning circuit. Problems with the hand
brake switch or the wiring could cause random tones but not pass enough juice
to light the warning lamp</p>

<p>Determining the problem line becomes a process of
elimination. Unplug the control terminals one at a time until the problem
stops.</p>



<p>Once you figure out what line is the problem you need to
decide what you are going to do to fix it. You have 2 choices. Trace the
circuit looking for problems or leave the terminal for that line unplugged. I
can't give you much other answer than that because tracing the circuits is
allot of work even if you know where they all go but leaving a chime dead presents
other problems, like people too stupid to look at the dash and see the brake
warning light is on and check the hand brake. If the chime is also screaming at
them the light is a little harder to ignore.</p>



<h2><a name="_Defect_Report_1"></a>Defect Report</h2>

<p><b><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana">NOTICE!!!</span></b></p>

<p>It has come to my
attention that there are 2(TWO) versions of chime box! At this time the 2 boxes
appear functionally identical and they should be interchangeable. The GM part
#'s are printed on the box but may have faded off.</p>

<p>The Old style one has
square corners and a door that opens to expose the whole back of the chime
board. It is unknown at this time what if any defects apply to the old style
box. If you have problems with this version, replace it with the new one. (The
GM part # for this box is 10024379. I don't believe this unit is still
available anywhere.) </p>

<p>The New style has rounded
corners and a door that opens on the small end opposite the terminals. (It is
pictured in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181135/http://web.archive.org/web/20060525224246/http://www.euronet.nl/users/fo_elmo/fiero.htm" target="_blank">Fiero Tech Zone</a> pictures.) It is the new style box that has the defect.
(The GM part # for this box is 10037040 and is still available thru some
dealers.)</p>

<p>The Chime box has a minor manufacturing defect, which can
make the box appear dead, cause weak chime sounds, cause chimes that come and
go, and random chime. This problem is easily corrected. </p>



<p>If you wiggle or squeeze the box and it affects the chime
sounds then you likely have this problem. This problem can be aggravated by
vibration and by handling the box. </p>



<p>The problem is the metal &quot;bridge&quot; that supports the chime
disk on the circuit board. This bridge is being used to make electrical
connections on the board. The end of the bridge closest the terminal end of the
board is not soldered well because of an incomplete circuit trace. This poor
joint cracks and screws up the chime. Note that this joint can be cracked with
little visual evidence.</p>



<p><a href="chime2.htm#defect" title="Large Image Of Defect Area.">
View Picture of defect area.</a> (Large Image, 138K.)</p>

<p>Reworking this connection should help cure most if not all
the problems. You will need a soldering iron/gun in about the 100watt range.
You need to heat the area quickly or you'll lift the copper off the board.
(Hold the iron on the bridge and let the solder carry the heat to the board.)
Low wattage irons will have trouble heating the bridge quickly enough because
of its mass and by the time the bridge heats enough the trace is too hot and
will likely be damaged. If the trace is not firmly attached to the board then
likely the board will fail again in the near future. Do not bridge solder to
any adjacent terminals.</p>

<p>This problem likely affects a very large number of chime
boxes. It is caused by poor design on the circuit board and use of high speed
soldering machines to assemble it. The bulk soldering equipment used to make
the board commonly has problems if the eyelets of the copper traces are not a
closed loop. In this case there isn't enough room to close the eye and keep enough
space between other traces. (If traces are too close the solder will bridge the
gap and make a short circuit.)</p>

<p>Because of the nature of this problem don't be surprised if
new or used replacement boxes have the same problem. New boxes may work when
you first get them and die in short order. <b>To prevent this problem avoid
handling the chime box by the large faces. </b></p>

<h3>How was this problem found?</h3>

<p>Several Chime boxes were tried in order to eliminate the
random tone but none of them did the job. Some were better but the random tones
where still there. In addition some boxes gave weak tones. Others were
intermittent, one second you'd get a good strong chime and the next you could
hardly hear the thing. (I've tried at least 5 boxes over the last year.)</p>

<p>Since multiple chime boxes have given similar results I
suspected the socket or a damaged terminal. To eliminate this I removed the
terminals from the socket one at a time and plugged all of them onto the chime
board. While checking terminals I held the box by the large sides and the tones
changed. When I let go of the box the tone changed again. Squeezed the box
again and sure enough tones changed.</p>

<p>Since I knew all the terminals where good now I put them
back into the socket and disassembled the box. I got the board out and looked
for things that could move when the board was flexed. The most obvious things
are the terminals and the chime support. Sure enough one end of the chime
support was loose. Soldered that back in place and now the box works perfect.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The defect joint is part of the main ground circuit on the
board. Just how bad problems caused by this joint cracking is hard to predict
because there is more than one way for a crack to form. The box can appear
dead, make really faint sounds, and half a dozen other things.</p>

<p>Why would the box make random tones if the joint cracks? The
main reason I suspect is the seatbelt warning function. When power gets
interrupted it can scramble the seatbelt circuit enough for it to let out a
tone. If the power interrupts long enough then it can even make the seatbelt
light come on until the timer runs out again. (The tone will also sound if the
seatbelt isn't buckled.)</p>
