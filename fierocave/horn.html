<h1>Tooting My Own Horn</h1>

<p>Ok... No more horn jokes...</p>

<h2>Horn Paddle Repairs:</h2>

<p>Does your Fiero have the &quot;paddle buttons&quot; steering wheel found in
many SE, GT, and Sport Coupes? Are yours broken? Do you still have all the
pieces? If you do then there is a RELIABLE way to fix them! </p>

<p>When the buttons break, they seldom do so cleanly. This is actually a good
thing! A &quot;dirty&quot; break allows nearly perfect realignment of the
parts, and since the white part usually breaks a little inside the gray paddle,
it's possible to get a totally invisible repair that lines up so well you'll
never know they were broken. Better yet, the repaired paddles are stronger than
original. </p>

<p>To start, head to your local auto parts dealer, or Kmart, and locate some
&quot;plastic welder&quot;, Devcon, and others, market it. This stuff is a
2-part Epoxy type adhesive. DO NOT waste your time with any one-part adhesives,
and NEVER use &quot;super glue&quot; on plastic. Neither will last in this
application, nor will they reinforce the paddle. (So called &quot;super
glue&quot; hardly ever works well on plastic.) </p>

<p class="warn">Warning: This adhesive is Very fast setting. You will have only
about 90 seconds of working time before the stuff is too thick to use. Use it
out doors! It stinks horridly! Sniffing this won't make you high. It will make
you sick or dead. </p>

<p>Take the switches off the steering wheel, and make sure the parts are free
of obvious dirt. (The adhesive is a combination Solvent welder/Epoxy. As long
as the parts are clean the adhesive will bind to it.) Dispense, and mix, the
adhesive on a disposable item, like cardboard. Apply the mixed compound with a
small wire, or tooth pick, to the edge of the white part, and inside the
paddle. Press the pieces together, and hold still until the adhesive sets. ((If
the break is deep enough into the paddle then it will pretty much hold itself
straight.)) </p>

<p>To reinforce the paddle, apply some adhesive to the back of the paddle
joint. You can be fairly liberal. You can even glue a bit of something across
the back of the gray/white joint to reinforce it. If you apply it to the front
of the buttons stay well inboard of the thick paddle end or your repair may
show. In fact, if your paddle buttons haven't broken yet, you could reinforce
them to keep them in one piece through all but the most severe beating.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> This steering wheel is used in other GM/Pontiac cars. The only
difference is the center cover. Check your local salvage yards for Grand-Am,
6000, Cavalier, and others, should you need new paddles or if your wheel is
badly torn up. There are both Leather and soft plastic rimmed versions of this
wheel.</p>

<h3>Why do so many paddle buttons break?</h3>

<p>The button is a two step molded part. The white part is cast then the
colored part is cast onto it. The colored plastic doesn't fully bond to the
white plastic. The result is a thin spot along the edge of the colored section.
So far all the ones I've seen broken all cracked from or along that line.</p>

<h3>Button Repair Update</h3>

<p class="warn">Warning! Don't try this in the car! The purple cleaner stains
really bad. The glue isn't much nicer.</p>

<p>One of the buttons I repaired with the plastic welder epoxy ended up broken
again. I was able to scrap the epoxy off the white part pretty easy. It stuck a
little better to the colored part but not much.</p>

<p>If you use the epoxy, you've got to get the plastic really clean, even then
I'm not sure if it will bond any better. </p>

<p>I wanted something fairly strong to clean the parts. Since it was handy, I
tried the purple cleaner for PVC pipe. I figured it would at least degrease the
plastic. (When cleaning, hold the broken edge down or the cleaner will run
where you don't want it.) To my pleasant surprise, the cleaner worked on the
horn button plastic just like it does on pipe. It cleaned the plastic and
slightly softened it.</p>

<p>So for giggles I tried the pipe cement instead of the epoxy this time.
You've got to be careful with the glue just like you were with the cleaner. It
will permanently scar any button plastic it gets on.... I put a little glue
along each side of the break and held the parts together.</p>

<p>You'll have to hold the parts considerably longer than with the epoxy. Once
they start to set leave them alone and let them cure at least overnight.</p>

<p>So far the result seems more promising than with the epoxy. I didn't even
bother to reinforce it with anything. The pipe glue bonds the white and the
colored plastics so the joint is now the same thickness as the rest of the
thing.</p>

<h3>Button Grounding</h3>

<p>(This may apply to other horn buttons besides the paddle style ones.)</p>

<p>If one button or the other won't work, you might have a ground problem and
not a bad button. The paddle buttons are grounded only thru the mounting
screws. In many cars, the screws have an anti rust coating. This coating is
known to keep the screws from making good electrical connection. If you have
hard to find horn problems, check these screws. Either replace them with bare
ones, or scrape the coating from the bottom of the head and along the threads.
You don't have to get them completely bare.</p>

<h2>Fixing OE Horns.</h2>

<p>Like many people, I had to fix my stupid meep meep horns recently. Here are
a few handy notes.</p>

<p>If the factory radio is working, the fuse is ok. If you have an aftermarket
radio, check the 25-amp BAT fuse.</p>

<p>If the horns don't sound the first thing to check is the relay in the
convenience center on the passenger's side. If the relay is clicking, the horn
button is working. If the relay isn't clicking try another one. If it still
won't click then the wiring has problems, most likely in the steering column. </p>

<p>A relay that clicks isn't automatically good. It could still have a cruddy
contact inside. If you don't have a spare relay, you can take the cover off to
check the contacts. You can also plug in the uncovered relay and short the
contacts to check the horns. (That's handy if the horn button may be acting up.
Expect a hefty spark when you do that.)</p>

<p>The odds are really good both horns are shot. I had one dead for a long
time. The other recently started sounding only when it felt like it. (BTW, Yes,
the horns can be dead and still pull power. This happens when the contact in
them welds itself closed.)</p>

<p>The horns are under the car. On mine they are mounted in front of each wheel
well and were pretty easy to get at. I did jack the car a little for more room
to work but I didn't have to crawl under it any.</p>

<p>So I yanked the trashed ones out and replaced them with some aftermarket
ones I had used on another car before I scrapped it. They sound nice on my Fiero.
They are loud but sort of mellow sounding instead of really shrill like most
air horns.</p>

<p>I mounted them in the same location as the OE horns. Better yet, you can
reuse the OE horn brackets. If you can't unscrew the bolt that holds the horn
on the bracket, simply drill or grind off the head. This gives you a much
better fit than the little tin strips that come with most aftermarket horns.</p>

<p>Don't forget to coat the horn terminal with dielectric to prevent corrosion.</p>

<p>Mount them so the trumpet points mostly down. This will help keep them from
collecting crap. In the OE location it will also direct the sound out of the
car body.</p>

<h3>Intermittent failures</h3>

<p>Once you've checked all the stuff above, you'll have to check the horn
button and the turn signal cam under the steering wheel. </p>

<p>The button(s) can usually be checked and fixed without removing the steering
wheel. Depending on which type is involved, you may be able to clean them out
with contact or brake parts cleaner. (The Paddle buttons are easy to clean but
others can be nearly impossible.)</p>

<p>To disconnect the button wire from the column, push in the sleeve, twist it
a little CCW, and it comes right out.</p>

<p>Problem with the turn signal cam will require you to remove the steering
wheel and lock plate. Notes for that are in the steering gear article.</p>

<p>The OE grease can gum up and prevent the slip ring on the signal cam from
making good contact with the brush. If the signal cam is good, clean it off
with contact or brake parts cleaner. Spray the spring-loaded brush with some
WD40 or other spray oil, and give the slip ring just enough to dampen it. Work
the contact after you spray it to make sure it's sliding freely in its hole.</p>

<p>If needed, you can get a new signal cam ring thru MotorMite's carded red
HELP! product line. The signal cam comes with the brass ring for the horn on
it. </p>

<h3>Test Tool</h3>

<p>Ok, You know the horns are good but you've got to fix a wiring problem and
you don't want the neighbors shooting at you... You need a way to simulate the
load of the horn without making noise.</p>

<p>Find yourself a spare sealed beam headlight and connect it between the horn
connector and ground. Almost any lamp will do. Two terminal high beam lamps are
easiest to use. If you have a three terminal lamp, hold the thing so the
terminals look like this-&gt; |_|. The terminal on the right is ground, bottom
is low beam, and left is high beam. For this you could even use a dual beam
lamp that has one filament burned out.</p>

<h2>Why to most car have two horn?</h2>
<p>Two horn are two Note. Two note made most sound that 1 note.</p>
<p class="quote">Horns can be used singly, but are often arranged in pairs to
produce a chord consisting of two notes, sounded together; although
this only increases the sound output by 3 decibels, the use of two
differing frequencies with their beat frequencies and missing
fundamental is more perceptible than the use of two horns of
identical frequency, particularly in an environment with a high
ambient noise level. Typical frequencies of a pair of horns of this
design are 500 and 405-420 Hz (approximately B<sub>4</sub> and G#<sub>4</sub>).
</p>
<p>Source: wiki <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181134/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_%28acoustic%29" target="_blank">Horn_(acoustic)</a></p>
<p>For that reason, when you take use horn from car then treat them
like match pare. You'll get better horn.</p>

<h4>But '88 has only one horn....</h4>

<p>So? Wire the second horn. Problem solved.</p>

<h2>Upgrade?</h2>

<p>You can buy a new horns of course. 
Hella and Fiamm makes OE Horns for EU cars.
Fiamm makes cheap replacement horns sold thru many stores but get OE horns at a junk yard.
Treat horns as a set for best results. Avoid horns from two cars/makers.
Try salvage yards and check BMW etc. (Also try using Search in PFF. 
Search terms like <i>Horn hella</i> in Archives.)
</p>

<h3>Air Horns</h3>

<p>I've used these on other cars. A bunch of people put them on Fiero, so I'm
putting in some notes for them too. I don't recommend them as the only horn on
the car. They have a nasty habit of splitting a diaphragm, which kills the
whole set. You'll know then that happens because they will go from nice and
loud to sounding like an asthmatic pig trying to squeal.</p>

<p>These can also piss off cops and state DMV inspectors. If these are your
only horn just pulse them quick during inspection. It's better to have the guy
ask you to hit the horn again than blow him off his feet. (This is true of any
really loud horn.)</p>

<p>Most air horns want to be used in short bursts. They'll tell you that right
in the instructions. Long burst can do weird things with the sound and may
accelerate wear on them.</p>

<p>If I do another set of these, I'd pickup the horn feed line somewhere and
install a selector switch. This way if the air horns break or I'm going to
inspection, I can switch back to the electric horns. Use a heavy-duty switch.
Try to put it someplace where water isn't running on it.</p>

<p>If you don't want a switch, unplug the connectors on the horns and pack them
with dielectric to keep them from corroding. Coat the terminals on the horns as
well.</p>

<p>If the OE horns are dead find some used ones in a salvage yard. This will
give you cheep backups when you need them.</p>

<p>You should still use the relay that comes with the air horn kit. To power
the air horns, you could use the main power feed for the radiator fan. If you
use the fan power you need to install a fuse in the horn wire. This circuit
would let you put all the wiring in the front compartments.</p>

<p>Use some fairly heavy wire for the compressor power feeds. 12-14awg. The
compressor draws a pretty good amount of juice.</p>

<p>There aren't a whole lot of mounting choices but keep in mind that the horns
will work better if the compressor breathes cool air. Also plan for things to
eventually break down. You'll want easy access to the whole mess. </p>

<p>You also want to keep the airlines as short as possible. Long lines will
take time to pressurize and could make the horns very lazy. (They will always
lag the horn button a little.)</p>

<p>The compressor will last longer if you can keep it clean and dry. </p>

<h2>Wiring</h2>

<p>Here's a common way to wire air or other high current horns. If you don't
want to install a switch at the indicated spot then just reach under the front
and unplug the OE horns. If you go that route, pack the OE terminals with
dielectric so they don't rot. You may need them in future.</p>

<p>You could also use this diagram to wire electronic musical horns. Most of
those you can feed directly from the OE relay.</p>
