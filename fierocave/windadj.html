<h1>Window Service</h1>

<h2>Adjustment</h2>

<p>There are several adjustments that affect window position
and function. When making adjustments go in small increments or you can damage
the window machinery or the door seal. The adjustments are the same for both
power and hand operated windows.</p>

<p class="warn">Warning! If you move a door from one car to another
then these adjustments MUST be checked carefully. Failure to get them right
will result in wind noise, water leaks, damage to the door seal or window
hardware, window breakage, or all the above.</p>

<p class="note">Note: Oops, This page isn't quite finished. I have to add
the picture as soon as I get the film processed. Sorry. (Easier to leave it
here now than edit links...)</p>

<h3>Upper stops</h3>

<p>There are 2 stops that set the upper limit of travel. (You
can't adjust the bottom.) They are near the front and rear top corners of the
door. Use these adjusters if the window is too far or not far enough up to seal
at the top. You can adjust the front and rear stop independently but keep in
mind that adjusting one may affect the other. (Blue dots in Picture 1)</p>

<h3>For/aft position</h3>

<p>There is a single wheel riding in a vertical track near the
rear of the door. The track is adjusted by loosening the nuts one the top and
bottom of the track. (The bottom must be loose or the top won't move.) This
track will move the window front to rear. Adjust this track if the window edge
doesn't align with the vertical sections of the door seal. If this track is to
far forward the window will bind in the front part of the door seal and damage
it. (Red dots in Picture 1)</p>

<h3>Pinch</h3>

<p>There are two pinch guides. These are on the top of the
door. Adjust them with the window down. Pinch the window only tight enough to
keep it in place. Over tightening these is part of why the windows get
scratched by the outside pinch guides on the Dew Wipe. (Green dots in Picture
1)</p>

<h3>Nose track</h3>

<p>The nose track should almost never need adjustment. However
if you are removing the door you'll find it much easier to remove the nose
track first. (You must move this track to get to the hinges from the interior
side of the door!) This track is held to the door framing by 2 bolts. With the
window up, and the outer skin off, it will drop out the bottom of the door once
the bolts are removed. Note that these 2 bolts are not the adjustment for the
nose track. The adjustment is on the upper bracket inside the door. (The bolts
to remove the nose track are the Yellow dots in Picture 1.)</p>

<h2>Hardware Cleaning &amp; Lubrication</h2>

<p>First off, don't spray anything on the nose or tail tracks that the glass
rides in. All you'll do is make a hell of a mess and you could even damage the
track lining. If the tracks are crudded up then tack them out and wash them.
Unless the tracks are out of adjustment, rare but can happen, they are unlikely
to be any problem.</p>

<p>For the rest of the tracks you'll need some &quot;white&quot; grease and some oil. For
the oil, I like Valvoline's SynPower Penetrating Spray Lubricant or Pyroil
White Lithium Grease. I've also used CRC 556 with good results. These products
penetrate but they carry more lubricant than products like WD 40 or Liquid
Wrench. WD-40 tends to evaporate and Liquid Wrench actually stiffens when cold.
(Liquid Wrench can freeze. Never use it in outdoor locks.)</p>

<p>What is White Grease and why use it? White Grease is very light Lithium
based grease. It doesn't stink like many other types of grease do when they get
warm. When you're doing work like the window tracks you want light grease that
won't stiffen much in cold weather and White grease fits that bill very well.
From past use, White grease appears less hostile to plastics than most regular
grease. I usually buy it in the over sized &quot;tooth paste tube&quot; style package.</p>

<p>The big problem with window lubrication is the rollers. They are usually
worn out and don't want to roll even with lubrication. With the tracks well
greased they will at least slide more easily. I think the rollers can be
replaced but you'll have to rip the entire door apart. I have no idea if or
where you can get new ones. You may be able to get decent ones of another GM
car. Try getting them from the passenger's door since that usually gets less
use, especially in cars w/o power windows. They look like they are just snapped
onto the pivots but I've never had the occasion to test that theory on Fiero.</p>

<h3>The Rollers </h3>

<p>The roller pivot gets a good shot with the spray lubricant. If the rollers
are in half decent shape this should wash the crud out of them. If you extend
the spray straw you can then bend it around to get the hard to reach ones.</p>

<h3>The Tracks</h3>

<p>The Vertical track runs up the door behind where the armrest goes. It's this
track that does most of the work of guiding the window. The window has two
wheels in that ride in it.</p>

<p>The Lift Track attached to the glass and it responsible for the actual up
and down motion. There are two rollers running in this track, the front one
will be a pain to get at.</p>

<ol start="1" type="1">
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">Lower the window and put some
     white grease into the track just above the rollers. </li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">Raise the window to the top
     and put some grease below the rollers.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;
     mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in">Run the window a couple times
     to spread the grease, add more as needed.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Regulator</h3>

<p>I use a screwdriver to spread the coils of the counter balance spring and
then drench it with spray oil to wash out the crud. After that I blot up as
much of the oil and dirt as I can then work in some white grease.</p>

<p>I give the pivot and crank shaft bearings a good shot of the spray oil and I
put some grease on the gear teeth. I usually use something heavier to grease
the gear teeth.</p>

<h3>Power Motors</h3>

<p>I find these motors rarely need internal work but in case you want to grease
inside these, make sure you don't get any lubricant on the brushes or armature.
Lube on there will usually kill the motor in short order.</p>

<p>The gears inside the motor need regular grease. The worm gear in there
generates quite allot of friction and pressure. Any good Molly or Synthetic
grease works well. </p>
