<h1>Ogre Does An Axle...</h1>

<p>Since I had to replace the other one recently, I figured it was time to
revisit this article.</p>

<p>The Constant Velocity shafts in Fiero aren't very difficult to work on but
it certainly helps to know a few tricks.</p>

<p class="note">Note: Replacing Axle? Keep the Shield on hub end CV. The Shield, called Deflector Ring in 22P and other Doc's from GM, 
protects hub bearing and stop thing, like small rope etc, wrapping up and binding between axle and knuckle. 
Most aftermarket axle won't come with Ring/Shield. Lost the ring? Not needed to drive car, just a safety item that most car makers uses...
</p>
<p><img src="axle_files/savethering.jpg"></p>
<h2>Check Axle length...</h2>
<p class="note">Do Not trust parts makers/dealers! Measure Axle itself.</p><p>This is Very important when you buy replacement axles. All Length are compress measured tip to tip, meaning Tripot internal spring is compressed. Too short/long you will have problems, Too short then break the Tripot or Too long can break the transmission.</p>

<h2>Axle Nut</h2>

<p class="warn">WARNING: The axle nut will need to be turned with a wrench for
all but the tip of the axle shaft and can get quite hot while spinning. Be
careful handling the nut and the socket. The nut can burn you. The socket may
get uncomfortably warm.</p>

<p>The 30mm locknut used on Fiero drive axles is intended to be a single use
item. It should be replaced each time it's removed. The nut isn't likely to
fall off. The axle can't come out even if it did, but if the nut comes loose
you can out wear the hub and axle splines in no time. At that point you'll need
a new hub and axle... (An axle with spline damage may not be accepted for
core... That could cost you from $20-50 above the normal cost of the axle.) </p>

<p>I strongly recommend a new nut any time the thing is off. It's cheap
insurance. ($3.00-$5.00) The nut is available at most parts stores. I won't
reuse one. This nut wears considerably when you work
with it and the heat of remove/replace messes with the hardness of the nut.</p>

<p>If you get a single click noise as you brake or accelerate then this nut may
not be tight enough. </p>

<p>(Torque spec source: Axle, Haynes Fiero repair book 79008. Lugs, Raybestos.)</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong><br>
<strong>The Service Manual doesn't allow used nuts.</strong> Says "install washer and new hub nut and tighten to 250-285 Nm (183-208 lb.ft.)."
 Source: 87 SM, page 4D-2, Step 7 in Install list. (Ignore drift pin... it won't work with solid rotors.)<br>
  
I don't recommend using an used nut. The nut wears each time you install and remove it.
A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151002181125/http://www.fiero.nl/forum/Archives/Archive-000001/HTML/20020511-2-018160.html" target="_blank">note in
the forums</a> indicates the correct torque is actually 170 ft-lbs for a used
nut.</p>

<p>To reach 200ft-lbs you'll need to be very strong or use about 3 feet of
handle on the socket.</p>

<p>You really want the wheel on to remove and replace the nut. The suspension
bounce can make it very difficult to tighten the nut. You could even knock the
car off the jacks trying to do it with the wheel off. You'll get the best
results if the car is on the ground with someone holding the brakes while you
tighten the nut. Use the spare tire if Aluminum wheels don't have enough room
to let the socket in.</p>

<h2>Axle Removal</h2>

<h3>Trick One</h3>

<p>There are a few ways to get the axle out. I prefer this one.</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0pt" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">Unfasten
     the brake line from the strut.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Unfasten
     the brake caliper from its mount and tie it up so it's not dangling from
     the cable or hose.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Remove
     the pinch bolt from the ball joint.</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Separate
     the ball joint.</li>
</ul>

<p>The whole assembly can now be swung out to clear the end of the axle without
messing with the tie rod.</p>

<p>If you push in on the axle, you'll compress the inner CV and gain additional
clearance.</p>

<p>Some people prefer to reverse this a bit. They leave the brake caliper
attached and separate the tie rod. If you do this be very careful you don't
damage the hand brake cable or the brake hose.</p>

<h3>Trick Two</h3>

<p>Note... The axle often lets go easier if you can give the thing a quick pop
instead of just prying on it.</p>

<p>A clip inside the transmission holds the axle. This can make extracting the
axle a pain.</p>

<p>With stubborn axles, it may easier to pop the axle if you use 2 pry bars.
Using 2 bars allows you to get an even load on the axle. </p>

<p>The clip isn't that strong but the thing usually exits the transmission
easier if the axle is pried straight. </p>

<p>Be careful where and how you pry on the transmission case. Avoid creating
spot loads on the case. Some areas can crack very easily if you pry directly on
them. Use blocks of wood as needed to prevent this.</p>

<p>When using 2 pry bars, this can be tricky. Tape the block to the bar so you
don't have to hold 4 things at once.</p>

<p>Yes, there is at least one tool for this... The one I've seen is a 2-armed
thing that connects to a slide hammer. Most people don't do this often enough
to need the tool.</p>

<h3>Trick 2A</h3>

<p>Another option for removing axle...</p>

<p>This needs two people; the helper needs to &quot;catch&quot; the axle.</p>

<p>For tools:</p>

<ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
 <li class="MsoNormal">You need a sledgehammer</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">A piece of chain</li>
 <li class="MsoNormal">Something to secure the end. Locks, bolts, repair link
     (Figure 1), etc. </li>
</ul>

<p>On tri-pot end, wrapped chain twice and secure it. (Figure 2)</p>

<p>On the other end of chain, wrapped the chain around a sledgehammer head twice
(Not Handle) and secure it.</p>

<p>Carefully use the hammer like a slide hammer, use the hammer with short
strokes. It should pop the axle.</p>

<h2>Seals</h2>
<p>(On transmission end, Hub seal with Hub unit below...)</p>

<p>Always replace the seal in the transmission anytime the axle is replaced! If
the seal is old, it's better to replace it even if you are reusing the same
axles. Better to do it now than risk a leak after...</p>

<p>If you score the mounting hole for the seal, clean the hole with brake parts
cleaner and then apply a thin coat of sealer. For most scratches I like a paint
type sealer like Permatex Super 300 or Balkamp Aviation sealer. If it's a deep
scratch then you may have to use RTV Silicone. Don't get sloppy with the
Silicone! A little bit goes a long way for this use.</p>


<h3>Removing</h3>

<p>Removing a seal often is no fun. The left seal is the worst on automatic trans.</p>

<p>For the right axle, you can often just pry it out. But be careful not to
damage anything. If it gives you trouble, then collapse the seal.</p>

<p>To start, remove the collar that protects the rubber seal. It's pressed into
the seal. The metal is soft, you should be able to cave the side in then pop it
out.</p>

<p>Then you'll be able to collapse the side of the seal and pull it out. Trust
me... taking the collar out makes the seal much easier to remove.</p>

<p>For the left side on the automatic... there is only one spot I found where
you could get a bite on the seal with the thing in the car. Unfasten the mud
skirt and go at it with a long screwdriver from the back. The screwdriver will
be against the cradle as far back as you can get it. Tap lightly until the seal
quits. Don't pound it or you could chip/crack the case. It helps some if you
collapse the inner part of the seal, where the rubber is held, and then cave in
the outer part.</p>

<h3>Installing</h3>

<p><strong>Coat outside seal and/or inside trans hole with Permatex Super 300 or High Tack sealant.</strong>
It should fix any small scratches in trans hole. Plus When wet acts as a lube, easier to drive seal.</p>

<p>Driving the seals is a pain. The best driver I've used for these is a
section of 2&quot; Schedule 40 PCV pipe. A regular driver, like the one from Lisle,
worked ok on the right seal but won't work for the left axle at all for auto trans. You have to
use pipe or a special tool for that one because the transmission shaft
protrudes thru the seal. The PCV pipe fit these seals very nicely and won't
damage the guard.</p>

<p>If you can't get a perfectly straight shot at the seal don't worry either...
Just cut the end of the pipe at a slight angle.</p>

<p>If you have a 2-3 pound mini sledge (AKA Drilling Hammer) use the side of
the head. If you only have a small hammer, use a block of wood to spread the
impact.</p>

<h2>Selecting Replacement Axles</h2>

<p>When buying new/rebuilt axles, it's fairly common to have the wrong axle in
a box! Lay the 2 shafts side by side and make sure they match before turning in
the core. (Yes, I have had this happen. Extremely annoying.)</p>

<p>Make sure new/rebuilt axles are the same length as the old ones! Never install
an axle that is the wrong length. Too long and you could bind the inner CV. Too
short and the inner CV will likely be torn apart. (This may not happen until
you go over a large bump.)</p>

<p>Also check outer CV profile. It must match the original. That means it has
to accept the guard ring as well as fit the seal and hub. </p>

<p>Don't worry if the CV boots are a different type as long as everything else
is correct. In fact, when you can find them, you want the ones with driven on
neoprene outer boots. They are better boots and clear the hand brake cable much
better than the thermoplastic ones that are clamped at both ends.</p>

<p>There should be a metal guard on the outer CV that is just lightly pressed
into place. This piece may need to be transferred to replacement axles. That
guard protects the hub seal from dirt and so on. Try not to mangle it when you
move it. It is better to work it off with a bunch of light tapping than try to
get it off in a couple shots.</p>

<p>No, you can't use an axle from an automatic in a stick or the other way
around. They won't fit.</p>

<h2>Extending CV life</h2>

<p>There's not much you can do that will affect the CV's but this might help.</p>

<p>Unless you live where speed bumps are common... Fiero outer CV joints spend
nearly all of their time operating in over a small angle. If you give the
wheels a few spins anytime the car is up on jacks it may help move the grease
around in there. It might not help much but it sure won't hurt anything. When
you do this, listen for noises and feel for any inaudible pops that may be early
signs of CV failure.</p>

<h2>Axles for other transmissions</h2>

<p>There have been many threads in the forums about this. Use the search
function and search for axles to find the others.</p>

<h2>Hub units</h2>

<p>The hub isn't hard to change. Again, anytime the axle is loose you should
use a new axle nut.</p>

<p>One important note about buying hubs... the 84-87 hubs should come with a
new seal loose in the box. This seal is driven into the knuckle to seal the
axle. It provides additional protection for the hub cavity in the knuckle. Make
sure the seal is in the box with the new hub. I don't think you can get it
separately. (Most hub units come with this seal.) These hubs should also come
with a large O ring, usually it's on the hub, that seals the front of the
cavity in the knuckle. These seals are to prevent the hub from rusting solid in
the knuckle. (The cavity isn't totally sealed. There is a drain hole below the
axle seal.)</p>


<p>Before you knock the old one out the back, make note of its position and
orientation. The new seal must be installed the same way.</p>

<p>The new seal is driven in from the front (hub) side. I strongly recommend a
seal driver for this. You'll want the control the driver gives you to keep the
seal straight.</p>

<p>Don't forget to grease the seal before installing the axle. I also coat the
inside of the knuckle hole with grease to prevent rust. You don't need to gob
it in, just coat things.</p>

<p class="note">Torque specification for the three bolts that
hold the hub to the knuckle is 62 lb.ft.(85
Nm) Source: 87 Fiero SM

<h3>Driving the axle seal on Hub end</h3>

<p>Use of a regular seal driver will force you to remove the axle to do the
job. There is another way...</p>

<p>Measure the depth of the seal in the knuckle! The new seal has to be driven
to the same depth. Didn't take any measurements? 
Drive seal until Bearing will just clear seal. Seal should stick out backside some, about 1/4 of seal depth. </p>

<p>The axle usually has enough slack to push back out of the seal enough to
work.</p>

<p>Knock the seal out the back of the knuckle, bend/squash it out of round and
then pull it out the front.</p>

<p>To drive the new seal...</p>

<p>Get a section of 2&quot; ID Schedule 40 PVC pipe and a straight connector.
Glue the connector to the pipe if needed. Use the connector end to drive the seal.</p>

<p>A large hammer works better than a small one. Not because you need to beat
the seal but because the big head spreads the load over the end of the pipe. I
use a 3# mini sledge turned sideways for this.</p>

<h3>No Grease Zone!</h3>

<p><img src="axle_files/image002.gif">
</p>

<p>You should grease the splines a little to prevent them rusting into the hub
but don't grease the areas shown above. 
You should also grease the axle seal to prevent wear.</p>
