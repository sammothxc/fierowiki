## 6. Accuracy and Disclaimer

All information on FieroWiki is provided **“as is”** without warranty or guarantee of any kind for **educational and preservational purposes only**.  
While FieroWiki and its maintainers strive for accuracy, some data may be incomplete, outdated, or contain errors. Use at your own discretion.

FieroWiki and its maintainers are **not responsible** for any damages, losses, or issues that result from the use or misuse of information on this site. 

FieroWiki is not affiliated with General Motors, the Pontiac brand, or any official Fiero organization.

While it is FieroWiki's mission of making this information available long-term, FieroWiki cannot perfectly guarantee permanence of any specific page, file, or piece of information, as the site may reorganize, correct, materials over time. Furthermore, as this site is self hosted in one place by the server owner in his dwelling, the server is vulnerable to natural disaster, extended power outages, internet outages, hardware failure, hacking, extreme financial hardship, death of the server owner, and acts of God. Protective measures have been put in place such as continuous syncronization with the [FieroWiki Github](https://github.com/sammothxc/fierowiki) and routine physical hardcopy backups in an attempt to make this information as available as possible for as long as possible outside of a guarantee of permanence.

Some writing may be produced by large language models such as ChatGPT to lighten the load of FieroWiki's maintainers, but all content produced in such a manner is always reviewed before release.

<br>

## 7. External Links

FieroWiki includes links to external websites and archives, such as the Internet Archive. These links are provided for reference only.

FieroWiki and its maintainers are not responsible for the content, availability, or accuracy of external sites.

<br>

## 8. Data Handling and Anti-Spam Measures

FieroWiki uses third-party services such as **Akismet** to filter spam in comments. These services may process data (such as IP addresses or text content) to identify unwanted activity.

For more information, please see the [Data Privacy page](/data-privacy).

<br>

## 9. Changes to These Terms

FieroWiki may update or revise these [Terms of Use](/terms-of-use) at any time. The most recent version will always be available on this page, with the “last updated” date shown above. Continued use of the site constitutes acceptance of any changes.
